Etiology is most \r\nlikely aseptic meningitis as she also had neck stiffness and \r\nsome mild photophobia. Her symptoms improved with supportive IV \r\nfluids, anti-emetics, and NSAIDs. At first she was started \r\nempirically on IV Vanc, IV cefepime, IV acyclovir, and Tamiflu \r\nto treat possible bacterial or HSV meningitis or influenza. \r\nRapid flu screen was negative so Tamiflu was stopped. She had no \r\nencephalitis and was on ppx acyclovir prior to presentation, so \r\nsuspicion of HSV meningoencephalitis was very low so IV \r\nacyclovir was stopped. Once ___ blood cultures were \r\nnegative >24 hours, IV antibiotics were also stopped. The \r\npatient continued to improve and was afebrile > 24 hrs prior to \r\ndischarge. \r\n\r\n# LYMPHOMA: s/p auto-stem cell transplant 44 days prior to \r\nadmission. She was continued on ppx bactrim and acyclovir. She \r\nwill f/u with her outpatient providers.\r\n\r\n# H/o DVT: Rivaroxaban was held while inpatient since we were at \r\nfirst considering lumbar puncture.

She had an exhaustive \r\nworkup of her fevers, including skin and psoas biopsies, and \r\ntissue uPCR was sent, but there was no culture positivity or \r\npositive findings in her infectious workup. However, after \r\nconsultation with ID, it was decided to treat empirically for \r\npresumptive osteomyelitis/discitis with 6 weeks of vancomycin \r\n(750mg IV q12h), cefepime (2g IV q12h), micafungin (100 mg PO \r\nq24h). Micafungin was chosen instead of posaconazole due to \r\n___ differences; but she did receive posaconazole while \r\ninpatient. Simultaneously, the patient was having significantly \r\nworsened back pain after her MDS diagnosing bone marrow biopsy. \r\nShe was started on opioid pain control, which was uptitrated and \r\naugmented with Valium to good effect. She went home with BID \r\noxycontin, PRN oxycodone, and QHS Valium. She will follow-up as \r\noutpatient with Dr. ___.\r\n\r\n# Fever + neutropenia: The patient received 2 doses of \r\ndecitabine as outpatient prior to experiencing first fever of \r\n101 at home, then 100.4 in clinic during third dose decitabine \r\nadministration. She was admitted for fever in setting of \r\ncytoreduction, and she eventually became truly neutropenic. An \r\nexhaustive workup was performed, centering on MRI findings of \r\npotential osteomyelitis/discitis with potential L psoas \r\ninvovlvement. This tissue was biopsied, negative by culture, and \r\nuPCR pending at the time of discharge. The patient will be given \r\nempiric therapy of vancomycin/cefepime/micafungin for a total of \r\n6 weeks (___) and instructed to have 1 month follow-up \r\nspinal imaging. A LLE wound was also biopsied and grew nothing. \r\nBy exclusion, decitabine is thought to be the likely culprit of \r\nthe fever.\r\n\r\n# left gluteal furuncle: Formed at the marked site of the ___ L \r\npsoas biopsy. By ultrasound found to only have subcutaneous \r\nedema without fluid collection. This will be followed by patient \r\nand outpatient team as potential new nidus of infection if \r\nappearing worse or causing pain.\r\n\r\n# low back pain: Acute on chronic in this patient, who has \r\nbaseline degenerative changes. She also had R iliac crest bone \r\nmarrow biopsy prior to this admission which may have caused \r\nhematoma, inflammatory, or direct nerve injury which contributed \r\nto her severe pain. She was uptitrated to a pain regimen \r\nincluding standing Oxycontin BID, oxycodone PRN, and Valium QHS, \r\nwhich she was able to tolerate with good effect. She worked with \r\n___ and was deemed fit for discharge home with services.\r\n\r\n# treatment related MDS: Secondary to autoSCT with BEAM \r\nconditioning for DLBCL. Patient had bone marrow biopsy which \r\ndiagnosed new-onset treatment related MDS, but may have also \r\ncaused severe acute-on-chronic back pain for which she is \r\nreceiving opioids and benzodiazapines. Will receive Bactrim for \r\nPCP prophylaxis starting at discharge.\r\n\r\n# history of DVT: History of LLE DVTs, on Rivaroxaban at home \r\nand IVC filter in place. Rivaroxaban was held once Plt<75k in \r\nsetting of multi-line decline from decitabine.\r\n\r\n# common variable immunodeficiency: Patient had multiple IgG \r\nchecks for known CVID and did not require IVIG as inpatient.\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n- complete 6 week antibiotics: vancomycin, cefepime, \r\nmicafungin(d1 = ___, end ___, follow-up with OPAT\r\n- weekly labs: CBC with differential, BUN, Cr, Vancomycin\r\ntrough, AST, ALT (fax to ATTN: ___ CLINIC - FAX: \r\n___\r\n- repeat MR ___ 1 month after discharge\r\n- PCP prophylaxis with ___ SS daily\r\n- plan future decitabine with Dr. ___ team\r\n- plan for curative transplant with Dr. ___ team\r\n- continue to monitor L gluteal furuncle\r\n- consider restarting rivaroxaban when deemed appropriate \r\n(stopped inpatient due to thrombocytopenia)\r\n- Code: Full\r\n- Contact: ___ (husband) ___\r\n \r\nMedications on Admission:\r\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\r\n1.

She had an exhaustive \r\nworkup of her fevers, including skin and psoas biopsies, and \r\ntissue uPCR was sent, but there was no culture positivity or \r\npositive findings in her infectious workup. However, after \r\nconsultation with ID, it was decided to treat empirically for \r\npresumptive osteomyelitis/discitis with 6 weeks of vancomycin \r\n(750mg IV q12h), cefepime (2g IV q12h), micafungin (100 mg PO \r\nq24h). Micafungin was chosen instead of posaconazole due to \r\n___ differences; but she did receive posaconazole while \r\ninpatient. Simultaneously, the patient was having significantly \r\nworsened back pain after her MDS diagnosing bone marrow biopsy. \r\nShe was started on opioid pain control, which was uptitrated and \r\naugmented with Valium to good effect. She went home with BID \r\noxycontin, PRN oxycodone, and QHS Valium. She will follow-up as \r\noutpatient with Dr. ___.\r\n\r\n# Fever + neutropenia: The patient received 2 doses of \r\ndecitabine as outpatient prior to experiencing first fever of \r\n101 at home, then 100.4 in clinic during third dose decitabine \r\nadministration. She was admitted for fever in setting of \r\ncytoreduction, and she eventually became truly neutropenic. An \r\nexhaustive workup was performed, centering on MRI findings of \r\npotential osteomyelitis/discitis with potential L psoas \r\ninvovlvement. This tissue was biopsied, negative by culture, and \r\nuPCR pending at the time of discharge. The patient will be given \r\nempiric therapy of vancomycin/cefepime/micafungin for a total of \r\n6 weeks (___) and instructed to have 1 month follow-up \r\nspinal imaging. A LLE wound was also biopsied and grew nothing. \r\nBy exclusion, decitabine is thought to be the likely culprit of \r\nthe fever.\r\n\r\n# left gluteal furuncle: Formed at the marked site of the ___ L \r\npsoas biopsy. By ultrasound found to only have subcutaneous \r\nedema without fluid collection. This will be followed by patient \r\nand outpatient team as potential new nidus of infection if \r\nappearing worse or causing pain.\r\n\r\n# low back pain: Acute on chronic in this patient, who has \r\nbaseline degenerative changes. She also had R iliac crest bone \r\nmarrow biopsy prior to this admission which may have caused \r\nhematoma, inflammatory, or direct nerve injury which contributed \r\nto her severe pain. She was uptitrated to a pain regimen \r\nincluding standing Oxycontin BID, oxycodone PRN, and Valium QHS, \r\nwhich she was able to tolerate with good effect. She worked with \r\n___ and was deemed fit for discharge home with services.\r\n\r\n# treatment related MDS: Secondary to autoSCT with BEAM \r\nconditioning for DLBCL. Patient had bone marrow biopsy which \r\ndiagnosed new-onset treatment related MDS, but may have also \r\ncaused severe acute-on-chronic back pain for which she is \r\nreceiving opioids and benzodiazapines. Will receive Bactrim for \r\nPCP prophylaxis starting at discharge.\r\n\r\n# history of DVT: History of LLE DVTs, on Rivaroxaban at home \r\nand IVC filter in place. Rivaroxaban was held once Plt<75k in \r\nsetting of multi-line decline from decitabine.\r\n\r\n# common variable immunodeficiency: Patient had multiple IgG \r\nchecks for known CVID and did not require IVIG as inpatient.\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n- complete 6 week antibiotics: vancomycin, cefepime, \r\nmicafungin(d1 = ___, end ___, follow-up with OPAT\r\n- weekly labs: CBC with differential, BUN, Cr, Vancomycin\r\ntrough, AST, ALT (fax to ATTN: ___ CLINIC - FAX: \r\n___\r\n- repeat MR ___ 1 month after discharge\r\n- PCP prophylaxis with ___ SS daily\r\n- plan future decitabine with Dr. ___ team\r\n- plan for curative transplant with Dr. ___ team\r\n- continue to monitor L gluteal furuncle\r\n- consider restarting rivaroxaban when deemed appropriate \r\n(stopped inpatient due to thrombocytopenia)\r\n- Code: Full\r\n- Contact: ___ (husband) ___\r\n \r\nMedications on Admission:\r\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\r\n1.

She had an exhaustive \r\nworkup of her fevers, including skin and psoas biopsies, and \r\ntissue uPCR was sent, but there was no culture positivity or \r\npositive findings in her infectious workup. However, after \r\nconsultation with ID, it was decided to treat empirically for \r\npresumptive osteomyelitis/discitis with 6 weeks of vancomycin \r\n(750mg IV q12h), cefepime (2g IV q12h), micafungin (100 mg PO \r\nq24h). Micafungin was chosen instead of posaconazole due to \r\n___ differences; but she did receive posaconazole while \r\ninpatient. Simultaneously, the patient was having significantly \r\nworsened back pain after her MDS diagnosing bone marrow biopsy. \r\nShe was started on opioid pain control, which was uptitrated and \r\naugmented with Valium to good effect. She went home with BID \r\noxycontin, PRN oxycodone, and QHS Valium. She will follow-up as \r\noutpatient with Dr. ___.\r\n\r\n# Fever + neutropenia: The patient received 2 doses of \r\ndecitabine as outpatient prior to experiencing first fever of \r\n101 at home, then 100.4 in clinic during third dose decitabine \r\nadministration. She was admitted for fever in setting of \r\ncytoreduction, and she eventually became truly neutropenic. An \r\nexhaustive workup was performed, centering on MRI findings of \r\npotential osteomyelitis/discitis with potential L psoas \r\ninvovlvement. This tissue was biopsied, negative by culture, and \r\nuPCR pending at the time of discharge. The patient will be given \r\nempiric therapy of vancomycin/cefepime/micafungin for a total of \r\n6 weeks (___) and instructed to have 1 month follow-up \r\nspinal imaging. A LLE wound was also biopsied and grew nothing. \r\nBy exclusion, decitabine is thought to be the likely culprit of \r\nthe fever.\r\n\r\n# left gluteal furuncle: Formed at the marked site of the ___ L \r\npsoas biopsy. By ultrasound found to only have subcutaneous \r\nedema without fluid collection. This will be followed by patient \r\nand outpatient team as potential new nidus of infection if \r\nappearing worse or causing pain.\r\n\r\n# low back pain: Acute on chronic in this patient, who has \r\nbaseline degenerative changes. She also had R iliac crest bone \r\nmarrow biopsy prior to this admission which may have caused \r\nhematoma, inflammatory, or direct nerve injury which contributed \r\nto her severe pain. She was uptitrated to a pain regimen \r\nincluding standing Oxycontin BID, oxycodone PRN, and Valium QHS, \r\nwhich she was able to tolerate with good effect. She worked with \r\n___ and was deemed fit for discharge home with services.\r\n\r\n# treatment related MDS: Secondary to autoSCT with BEAM \r\nconditioning for DLBCL. Patient had bone marrow biopsy which \r\ndiagnosed new-onset treatment related MDS, but may have also \r\ncaused severe acute-on-chronic back pain for which she is \r\nreceiving opioids and benzodiazapines. Will receive Bactrim for \r\nPCP prophylaxis starting at discharge.\r\n\r\n# history of DVT: History of LLE DVTs, on Rivaroxaban at home \r\nand IVC filter in place. Rivaroxaban was held once Plt<75k in \r\nsetting of multi-line decline from decitabine.\r\n\r\n# common variable immunodeficiency: Patient had multiple IgG \r\nchecks for known CVID and did not require IVIG as inpatient.\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n- complete 6 week antibiotics: vancomycin, cefepime, \r\nmicafungin(d1 = ___, end ___, follow-up with OPAT\r\n- weekly labs: CBC with differential, BUN, Cr, Vancomycin\r\ntrough, AST, ALT (fax to ATTN: ___ CLINIC - FAX: \r\n___\r\n- repeat MR ___ 1 month after discharge\r\n- PCP prophylaxis with ___ SS daily\r\n- plan future decitabine with Dr. ___ team\r\n- plan for curative transplant with Dr. ___ team\r\n- continue to monitor L gluteal furuncle\r\n- consider restarting rivaroxaban when deemed appropriate \r\n(stopped inpatient due to thrombocytopenia)\r\n- Code: Full\r\n- Contact: ___ (husband) ___\r\n \r\nMedications on Admission:\r\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\r\n1.

The left atrial volume index \r\nis mildly increased. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ \r\nmmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and \r\nregional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The \r\nestimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue \r\nDoppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling \r\npressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free \r\nwall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly \r\nthickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or \r\nvegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic valve \r\nabscess is seen. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral \r\nvalve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve \r\nprolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. \r\nMild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate \r\npulmonary artery systolic hypertension. No vegetation/mass is \r\nseen on the pulmonic valve. There is an anterior space which \r\nmost likely represents a prominent fat pad. \r\n\r\nIMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis. \r\nNormal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and \r\nregional biventricular systolic function. Suggestion of elevated \r\nLV filling pressure. Mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. \r\nModerate pulmonary hypertension.\r\n\r\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \r\nthe degrees of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation are slightly \r\ngreater and the estimated pulmonary arterial pressure is higher.\r\n\r\nIMAGING:\r\n___ L gluteal U/S:\r\nIMPRESSION:\r\nInflammation or edema of the superficial soft tissues without \r\nfocal fluid\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\n___ MR ___:\r\nIMPRESSION:\r\n1. Severe multilevel degenerative changes as described above \r\nhave slightly\r\nprogressed since the prior examination of ___.\r\n2. Scoliosis of lumbar spine with  signal changes and edema \r\nedema in the\r\nendplates, mild adjacent soft tissue signal and enhancement and \r\nenhancement in the left psoas muscle at L4-5 level without \r\nepidural phlegmon or paraspinal fluid collection are \r\nnonspecific.

She had an exhaustive \r\nworkup of her fevers, including skin and psoas biopsies, and \r\ntissue uPCR was sent, but there was no culture positivity or \r\npositive findings in her infectious workup. However, after \r\nconsultation with ID, it was decided to treat empirically for \r\npresumptive osteomyelitis/discitis with 6 weeks of vancomycin \r\n(750mg IV q12h), cefepime (2g IV q12h), micafungin (100 mg PO \r\nq24h). Micafungin was chosen instead of posaconazole due to \r\n___ differences; but she did receive posaconazole while \r\ninpatient. Simultaneously, the patient was having significantly \r\nworsened back pain after her MDS diagnosing bone marrow biopsy. \r\nShe was started on opioid pain control, which was uptitrated and \r\naugmented with Valium to good effect. She went home with BID \r\noxycontin, PRN oxycodone, and QHS Valium. She will follow-up as \r\noutpatient with Dr. ___.\r\n\r\n# Fever + neutropenia: The patient received 2 doses of \r\ndecitabine as outpatient prior to experiencing first fever of \r\n101 at home, then 100.4 in clinic during third dose decitabine \r\nadministration. She was admitted for fever in setting of \r\ncytoreduction, and she eventually became truly neutropenic. An \r\nexhaustive workup was performed, centering on MRI findings of \r\npotential osteomyelitis/discitis with potential L psoas \r\ninvovlvement. This tissue was biopsied, negative by culture, and \r\nuPCR pending at the time of discharge. The patient will be given \r\nempiric therapy of vancomycin/cefepime/micafungin for a total of \r\n6 weeks (___) and instructed to have 1 month follow-up \r\nspinal imaging. A LLE wound was also biopsied and grew nothing. \r\nBy exclusion, decitabine is thought to be the likely culprit of \r\nthe fever.\r\n\r\n# left gluteal furuncle: Formed at the marked site of the ___ L \r\npsoas biopsy. By ultrasound found to only have subcutaneous \r\nedema without fluid collection. This will be followed by patient \r\nand outpatient team as potential new nidus of infection if \r\nappearing worse or causing pain.\r\n\r\n# low back pain: Acute on chronic in this patient, who has \r\nbaseline degenerative changes. She also had R iliac crest bone \r\nmarrow biopsy prior to this admission which may have caused \r\nhematoma, inflammatory, or direct nerve injury which contributed \r\nto her severe pain. She was uptitrated to a pain regimen \r\nincluding standing Oxycontin BID, oxycodone PRN, and Valium QHS, \r\nwhich she was able to tolerate with good effect. She worked with \r\n___ and was deemed fit for discharge home with services.\r\n\r\n# treatment related MDS: Secondary to autoSCT with BEAM \r\nconditioning for DLBCL. Patient had bone marrow biopsy which \r\ndiagnosed new-onset treatment related MDS, but may have also \r\ncaused severe acute-on-chronic back pain for which she is \r\nreceiving opioids and benzodiazapines. Will receive Bactrim for \r\nPCP prophylaxis starting at discharge.\r\n\r\n# history of DVT: History of LLE DVTs, on Rivaroxaban at home \r\nand IVC filter in place. Rivaroxaban was held once Plt<75k in \r\nsetting of multi-line decline from decitabine.\r\n\r\n# common variable immunodeficiency: Patient had multiple IgG \r\nchecks for known CVID and did not require IVIG as inpatient.\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n- complete 6 week antibiotics: vancomycin, cefepime, \r\nmicafungin(d1 = ___, end ___, follow-up with OPAT\r\n- weekly labs: CBC with differential, BUN, Cr, Vancomycin\r\ntrough, AST, ALT (fax to ATTN: ___ CLINIC - FAX: \r\n___\r\n- repeat MR ___ 1 month after discharge\r\n- PCP prophylaxis with ___ SS daily\r\n- plan future decitabine with Dr. ___ team\r\n- plan for curative transplant with Dr. ___ team\r\n- continue to monitor L gluteal furuncle\r\n- consider restarting rivaroxaban when deemed appropriate \r\n(stopped inpatient due to thrombocytopenia)\r\n- Code: Full\r\n- Contact: ___ (husband) ___\r\n \r\nMedications on Admission:\r\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\r\n1.

Tissue \r\nDoppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling \r\npressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free \r\nwall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly \r\nthickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or \r\nvegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic valve \r\nabscess is seen. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral \r\nvalve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve \r\nprolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. \r\nMild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate \r\npulmonary artery systolic hypertension. No vegetation/mass is \r\nseen on the pulmonic valve.

She had an exhaustive \r\nworkup of her fevers, including skin and psoas biopsies, and \r\ntissue uPCR was sent, but there was no culture positivity or \r\npositive findings in her infectious workup. However, after \r\nconsultation with ID, it was decided to treat empirically for \r\npresumptive osteomyelitis/discitis with 6 weeks of vancomycin \r\n(750mg IV q12h), cefepime (2g IV q12h), micafungin (100 mg PO \r\nq24h). Micafungin was chosen instead of posaconazole due to \r\n___ differences; but she did receive posaconazole while \r\ninpatient. Simultaneously, the patient was having significantly \r\nworsened back pain after her MDS diagnosing bone marrow biopsy. \r\nShe was started on opioid pain control, which was uptitrated and \r\naugmented with Valium to good effect. She went home with BID \r\noxycontin, PRN oxycodone, and QHS Valium. She will follow-up as \r\noutpatient with Dr. ___.\r\n\r\n# Fever + neutropenia: The patient received 2 doses of \r\ndecitabine as outpatient prior to experiencing first fever of \r\n101 at home, then 100.4 in clinic during third dose decitabine \r\nadministration. She was admitted for fever in setting of \r\ncytoreduction, and she eventually became truly neutropenic. An \r\nexhaustive workup was performed, centering on MRI findings of \r\npotential osteomyelitis/discitis with potential L psoas \r\ninvovlvement. This tissue was biopsied, negative by culture, and \r\nuPCR pending at the time of discharge. The patient will be given \r\nempiric therapy of vancomycin/cefepime/micafungin for a total of \r\n6 weeks (___) and instructed to have 1 month follow-up \r\nspinal imaging. A LLE wound was also biopsied and grew nothing. \r\nBy exclusion, decitabine is thought to be the likely culprit of \r\nthe fever.\r\n\r\n# left gluteal furuncle: Formed at the marked site of the ___ L \r\npsoas biopsy. By ultrasound found to only have subcutaneous \r\nedema without fluid collection. This will be followed by patient \r\nand outpatient team as potential new nidus of infection if \r\nappearing worse or causing pain.\r\n\r\n# low back pain: Acute on chronic in this patient, who has \r\nbaseline degenerative changes. She also had R iliac crest bone \r\nmarrow biopsy prior to this admission which may have caused \r\nhematoma, inflammatory, or direct nerve injury which contributed \r\nto her severe pain. She was uptitrated to a pain regimen \r\nincluding standing Oxycontin BID, oxycodone PRN, and Valium QHS, \r\nwhich she was able to tolerate with good effect. She worked with \r\n___ and was deemed fit for discharge home with services.\r\n\r\n# treatment related MDS: Secondary to autoSCT with BEAM \r\nconditioning for DLBCL. Patient had bone marrow biopsy which \r\ndiagnosed new-onset treatment related MDS, but may have also \r\ncaused severe acute-on-chronic back pain for which she is \r\nreceiving opioids and benzodiazapines. Will receive Bactrim for \r\nPCP prophylaxis starting at discharge.\r\n\r\n# history of DVT: History of LLE DVTs, on Rivaroxaban at home \r\nand IVC filter in place. Rivaroxaban was held once Plt<75k in \r\nsetting of multi-line decline from decitabine.\r\n\r\n# common variable immunodeficiency: Patient had multiple IgG \r\nchecks for known CVID and did not require IVIG as inpatient.\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n- complete 6 week antibiotics: vancomycin, cefepime, \r\nmicafungin(d1 = ___, end ___, follow-up with OPAT\r\n- weekly labs: CBC with differential, BUN, Cr, Vancomycin\r\ntrough, AST, ALT (fax to ATTN: ___ CLINIC - FAX: \r\n___\r\n- repeat MR ___ 1 month after discharge\r\n- PCP prophylaxis with ___ SS daily\r\n- plan future decitabine with Dr. ___ team\r\n- plan for curative transplant with Dr. ___ team\r\n- continue to monitor L gluteal furuncle\r\n- consider restarting rivaroxaban when deemed appropriate \r\n(stopped inpatient due to thrombocytopenia)\r\n- Code: Full\r\n- Contact: ___ (husband) ___\r\n \r\nMedications on Admission:\r\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\r\n1.

She had an exhaustive \r\nworkup of her fevers, including skin and psoas biopsies, and \r\ntissue uPCR was sent, but there was no culture positivity or \r\npositive findings in her infectious workup. However, after \r\nconsultation with ID, it was decided to treat empirically for \r\npresumptive osteomyelitis/discitis with 6 weeks of vancomycin \r\n(750mg IV q12h), cefepime (2g IV q12h), micafungin (100 mg PO \r\nq24h). Micafungin was chosen instead of posaconazole due to \r\n___ differences; but she did receive posaconazole while \r\ninpatient. Simultaneously, the patient was having significantly \r\nworsened back pain after her MDS diagnosing bone marrow biopsy. \r\nShe was started on opioid pain control, which was uptitrated and \r\naugmented with Valium to good effect. She went home with BID \r\noxycontin, PRN oxycodone, and QHS Valium. She will follow-up as \r\noutpatient with Dr. ___.\r\n\r\n# Fever + neutropenia: The patient received 2 doses of \r\ndecitabine as outpatient prior to experiencing first fever of \r\n101 at home, then 100.4 in clinic during third dose decitabine \r\nadministration. She was admitted for fever in setting of \r\ncytoreduction, and she eventually became truly neutropenic. An \r\nexhaustive workup was performed, centering on MRI findings of \r\npotential osteomyelitis/discitis with potential L psoas \r\ninvovlvement. This tissue was biopsied, negative by culture, and \r\nuPCR pending at the time of discharge. The patient will be given \r\nempiric therapy of vancomycin/cefepime/micafungin for a total of \r\n6 weeks (___) and instructed to have 1 month follow-up \r\nspinal imaging. A LLE wound was also biopsied and grew nothing. \r\nBy exclusion, decitabine is thought to be the likely culprit of \r\nthe fever.\r\n\r\n# left gluteal furuncle: Formed at the marked site of the ___ L \r\npsoas biopsy. By ultrasound found to only have subcutaneous \r\nedema without fluid collection. This will be followed by patient \r\nand outpatient team as potential new nidus of infection if \r\nappearing worse or causing pain.\r\n\r\n# low back pain: Acute on chronic in this patient, who has \r\nbaseline degenerative changes. She also had R iliac crest bone \r\nmarrow biopsy prior to this admission which may have caused \r\nhematoma, inflammatory, or direct nerve injury which contributed \r\nto her severe pain. She was uptitrated to a pain regimen \r\nincluding standing Oxycontin BID, oxycodone PRN, and Valium QHS, \r\nwhich she was able to tolerate with good effect. She worked with \r\n___ and was deemed fit for discharge home with services.\r\n\r\n# treatment related MDS: Secondary to autoSCT with BEAM \r\nconditioning for DLBCL. Patient had bone marrow biopsy which \r\ndiagnosed new-onset treatment related MDS, but may have also \r\ncaused severe acute-on-chronic back pain for which she is \r\nreceiving opioids and benzodiazapines. Will receive Bactrim for \r\nPCP prophylaxis starting at discharge.\r\n\r\n# history of DVT: History of LLE DVTs, on Rivaroxaban at home \r\nand IVC filter in place.

Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and \r\nregional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The \r\nestimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue \r\nDoppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling \r\npressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free \r\nwall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly \r\nthickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or \r\nvegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic valve \r\nabscess is seen. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral \r\nvalve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve \r\nprolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. \r\nMild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate \r\npulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

She had an exhaustive \r\nworkup of her fevers, including skin and psoas biopsies, and \r\ntissue uPCR was sent, but there was no culture positivity or \r\npositive findings in her infectious workup. However, after \r\nconsultation with ID, it was decided to treat empirically for \r\npresumptive osteomyelitis/discitis with 6 weeks of vancomycin \r\n(750mg IV q12h), cefepime (2g IV q12h), micafungin (100 mg PO \r\nq24h). Micafungin was chosen instead of posaconazole due to \r\n___ differences; but she did receive posaconazole while \r\ninpatient. Simultaneously, the patient was having significantly \r\nworsened back pain after her MDS diagnosing bone marrow biopsy. \r\nShe was started on opioid pain control, which was uptitrated and \r\naugmented with Valium to good effect. She went home with BID \r\noxycontin, PRN oxycodone, and QHS Valium. She will follow-up as \r\noutpatient with Dr. ___.\r\n\r\n# Fever + neutropenia: The patient received 2 doses of \r\ndecitabine as outpatient prior to experiencing first fever of \r\n101 at home, then 100.4 in clinic during third dose decitabine \r\nadministration. She was admitted for fever in setting of \r\ncytoreduction, and she eventually became truly neutropenic. An \r\nexhaustive workup was performed, centering on MRI findings of \r\npotential osteomyelitis/discitis with potential L psoas \r\ninvovlvement. This tissue was biopsied, negative by culture, and \r\nuPCR pending at the time of discharge. The patient will be given \r\nempiric therapy of vancomycin/cefepime/micafungin for a total of \r\n6 weeks (___) and instructed to have 1 month follow-up \r\nspinal imaging. A LLE wound was also biopsied and grew nothing. \r\nBy exclusion, decitabine is thought to be the likely culprit of \r\nthe fever.\r\n\r\n# left gluteal furuncle: Formed at the marked site of the ___ L \r\npsoas biopsy. By ultrasound found to only have subcutaneous \r\nedema without fluid collection. This will be followed by patient \r\nand outpatient team as potential new nidus of infection if \r\nappearing worse or causing pain.\r\n\r\n# low back pain: Acute on chronic in this patient, who has \r\nbaseline degenerative changes. She also had R iliac crest bone \r\nmarrow biopsy prior to this admission which may have caused \r\nhematoma, inflammatory, or direct nerve injury which contributed \r\nto her severe pain. She was uptitrated to a pain regimen \r\nincluding standing Oxycontin BID, oxycodone PRN, and Valium QHS, \r\nwhich she was able to tolerate with good effect. She worked with \r\n___ and was deemed fit for discharge home with services.\r\n\r\n# treatment related MDS: Secondary to autoSCT with BEAM \r\nconditioning for DLBCL. Patient had bone marrow biopsy which \r\ndiagnosed new-onset treatment related MDS, but may have also \r\ncaused severe acute-on-chronic back pain for which she is \r\nreceiving opioids and benzodiazapines.

She had an exhaustive \r\nworkup of her fevers, including skin and psoas biopsies, and \r\ntissue uPCR was sent, but there was no culture positivity or \r\npositive findings in her infectious workup. However, after \r\nconsultation with ID, it was decided to treat empirically for \r\npresumptive osteomyelitis/discitis with 6 weeks of vancomycin \r\n(750mg IV q12h), cefepime (2g IV q12h), micafungin (100 mg PO \r\nq24h). Micafungin was chosen instead of posaconazole due to \r\n___ differences; but she did receive posaconazole while \r\ninpatient. Simultaneously, the patient was having significantly \r\nworsened back pain after her MDS diagnosing bone marrow biopsy. \r\nShe was started on opioid pain control, which was uptitrated and \r\naugmented with Valium to good effect. She went home with BID \r\noxycontin, PRN oxycodone, and QHS Valium. She will follow-up as \r\noutpatient with Dr. ___.\r\n\r\n# Fever + neutropenia: The patient received 2 doses of \r\ndecitabine as outpatient prior to experiencing first fever of \r\n101 at home, then 100.4 in clinic during third dose decitabine \r\nadministration. She was admitted for fever in setting of \r\ncytoreduction, and she eventually became truly neutropenic. An \r\nexhaustive workup was performed, centering on MRI findings of \r\npotential osteomyelitis/discitis with potential L psoas \r\ninvovlvement. This tissue was biopsied, negative by culture, and \r\nuPCR pending at the time of discharge. The patient will be given \r\nempiric therapy of vancomycin/cefepime/micafungin for a total of \r\n6 weeks (___) and instructed to have 1 month follow-up \r\nspinal imaging. A LLE wound was also biopsied and grew nothing. \r\nBy exclusion, decitabine is thought to be the likely culprit of \r\nthe fever.\r\n\r\n# left gluteal furuncle: Formed at the marked site of the ___ L \r\npsoas biopsy. By ultrasound found to only have subcutaneous \r\nedema without fluid collection. This will be followed by patient \r\nand outpatient team as potential new nidus of infection if \r\nappearing worse or causing pain.\r\n\r\n# low back pain: Acute on chronic in this patient, who has \r\nbaseline degenerative changes. She also had R iliac crest bone \r\nmarrow biopsy prior to this admission which may have caused \r\nhematoma, inflammatory, or direct nerve injury which contributed \r\nto her severe pain. She was uptitrated to a pain regimen \r\nincluding standing Oxycontin BID, oxycodone PRN, and Valium QHS, \r\nwhich she was able to tolerate with good effect. She worked with \r\n___ and was deemed fit for discharge home with services.\r\n\r\n# treatment related MDS: Secondary to autoSCT with BEAM \r\nconditioning for DLBCL. Patient had bone marrow biopsy which \r\ndiagnosed new-onset treatment related MDS, but may have also \r\ncaused severe acute-on-chronic back pain for which she is \r\nreceiving opioids and benzodiazapines. Will receive Bactrim for \r\nPCP prophylaxis starting at discharge.\r\n\r\n# history of DVT: History of LLE DVTs, on Rivaroxaban at home \r\nand IVC filter in place.

Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and \r\nregional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The \r\nestimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue \r\nDoppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling \r\npressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free \r\nwall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly \r\nthickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or \r\nvegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic valve \r\nabscess is seen. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral \r\nvalve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve \r\nprolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. \r\nMild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate \r\npulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

She had an exhaustive \r\nworkup of her fevers, including skin and psoas biopsies, and \r\ntissue uPCR was sent, but there was no culture positivity or \r\npositive findings in her infectious workup. However, after \r\nconsultation with ID, it was decided to treat empirically for \r\npresumptive osteomyelitis/discitis with 6 weeks of vancomycin \r\n(750mg IV q12h), cefepime (2g IV q12h), micafungin (100 mg PO \r\nq24h). Micafungin was chosen instead of posaconazole due to \r\n___ differences; but she did receive posaconazole while \r\ninpatient. Simultaneously, the patient was having significantly \r\nworsened back pain after her MDS diagnosing bone marrow biopsy. \r\nShe was started on opioid pain control, which was uptitrated and \r\naugmented with Valium to good effect. She went home with BID \r\noxycontin, PRN oxycodone, and QHS Valium. She will follow-up as \r\noutpatient with Dr. ___.\r\n\r\n# Fever + neutropenia: The patient received 2 doses of \r\ndecitabine as outpatient prior to experiencing first fever of \r\n101 at home, then 100.4 in clinic during third dose decitabine \r\nadministration. She was admitted for fever in setting of \r\ncytoreduction, and she eventually became truly neutropenic. An \r\nexhaustive workup was performed, centering on MRI findings of \r\npotential osteomyelitis/discitis with potential L psoas \r\ninvovlvement. This tissue was biopsied, negative by culture, and \r\nuPCR pending at the time of discharge. The patient will be given \r\nempiric therapy of vancomycin/cefepime/micafungin for a total of \r\n6 weeks (___) and instructed to have 1 month follow-up \r\nspinal imaging. A LLE wound was also biopsied and grew nothing. \r\nBy exclusion, decitabine is thought to be the likely culprit of \r\nthe fever.\r\n\r\n# left gluteal furuncle: Formed at the marked site of the ___ L \r\npsoas biopsy. By ultrasound found to only have subcutaneous \r\nedema without fluid collection. This will be followed by patient \r\nand outpatient team as potential new nidus of infection if \r\nappearing worse or causing pain.\r\n\r\n# low back pain: Acute on chronic in this patient, who has \r\nbaseline degenerative changes. She also had R iliac crest bone \r\nmarrow biopsy prior to this admission which may have caused \r\nhematoma, inflammatory, or direct nerve injury which contributed \r\nto her severe pain. She was uptitrated to a pain regimen \r\nincluding standing Oxycontin BID, oxycodone PRN, and Valium QHS, \r\nwhich she was able to tolerate with good effect. She worked with \r\n___ and was deemed fit for discharge home with services.\r\n\r\n# treatment related MDS: Secondary to autoSCT with BEAM \r\nconditioning for DLBCL. Patient had bone marrow biopsy which \r\ndiagnosed new-onset treatment related MDS, but may have also \r\ncaused severe acute-on-chronic back pain for which she is \r\nreceiving opioids and benzodiazapines. Will receive Bactrim for \r\nPCP prophylaxis starting at discharge.\r\n\r\n# history of DVT: History of LLE DVTs, on Rivaroxaban at home \r\nand IVC filter in place. Rivaroxaban was held once Plt<75k in \r\nsetting of multi-line decline from decitabine.\r\n\r\n# common variable immunodeficiency: Patient had multiple IgG \r\nchecks for known CVID and did not require IVIG as inpatient.\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n- complete 6 week antibiotics: vancomycin, cefepime, \r\nmicafungin(d1 = ___, end ___, follow-up with OPAT\r\n- weekly labs: CBC with differential, BUN, Cr, Vancomycin\r\ntrough, AST, ALT (fax to ATTN: ___ CLINIC - FAX: \r\n___\r\n- repeat MR ___ 1 month after discharge\r\n- PCP prophylaxis with ___ SS daily\r\n- plan future decitabine with Dr. ___ team\r\n- plan for curative transplant with Dr. ___ team\r\n- continue to monitor L gluteal furuncle\r\n- consider restarting rivaroxaban when deemed appropriate \r\n(stopped inpatient due to thrombocytopenia)\r\n- Code: Full\r\n- Contact: ___ (husband) ___\r\n \r\nMedications on Admission:\r\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\r\n1.

She had an exhaustive \r\nworkup of her fevers, including skin and psoas biopsies, and \r\ntissue uPCR was sent, but there was no culture positivity or \r\npositive findings in her infectious workup. However, after \r\nconsultation with ID, it was decided to treat empirically for \r\npresumptive osteomyelitis/discitis with 6 weeks of vancomycin \r\n(750mg IV q12h), cefepime (2g IV q12h), micafungin (100 mg PO \r\nq24h). Micafungin was chosen instead of posaconazole due to \r\n___ differences; but she did receive posaconazole while \r\ninpatient. Simultaneously, the patient was having significantly \r\nworsened back pain after her MDS diagnosing bone marrow biopsy. \r\nShe was started on opioid pain control, which was uptitrated and \r\naugmented with Valium to good effect. She went home with BID \r\noxycontin, PRN oxycodone, and QHS Valium. She will follow-up as \r\noutpatient with Dr. ___.\r\n\r\n# Fever + neutropenia: The patient received 2 doses of \r\ndecitabine as outpatient prior to experiencing first fever of \r\n101 at home, then 100.4 in clinic during third dose decitabine \r\nadministration. She was admitted for fever in setting of \r\ncytoreduction, and she eventually became truly neutropenic. An \r\nexhaustive workup was performed, centering on MRI findings of \r\npotential osteomyelitis/discitis with potential L psoas \r\ninvovlvement. This tissue was biopsied, negative by culture, and \r\nuPCR pending at the time of discharge. The patient will be given \r\nempiric therapy of vancomycin/cefepime/micafungin for a total of \r\n6 weeks (___) and instructed to have 1 month follow-up \r\nspinal imaging. A LLE wound was also biopsied and grew nothing. \r\nBy exclusion, decitabine is thought to be the likely culprit of \r\nthe fever.\r\n\r\n# left gluteal furuncle: Formed at the marked site of the ___ L \r\npsoas biopsy. By ultrasound found to only have subcutaneous \r\nedema without fluid collection. This will be followed by patient \r\nand outpatient team as potential new nidus of infection if \r\nappearing worse or causing pain.\r\n\r\n# low back pain: Acute on chronic in this patient, who has \r\nbaseline degenerative changes. She also had R iliac crest bone \r\nmarrow biopsy prior to this admission which may have caused \r\nhematoma, inflammatory, or direct nerve injury which contributed \r\nto her severe pain. She was uptitrated to a pain regimen \r\nincluding standing Oxycontin BID, oxycodone PRN, and Valium QHS, \r\nwhich she was able to tolerate with good effect. She worked with \r\n___ and was deemed fit for discharge home with services.\r\n\r\n# treatment related MDS: Secondary to autoSCT with BEAM \r\nconditioning for DLBCL. Patient had bone marrow biopsy which \r\ndiagnosed new-onset treatment related MDS, but may have also \r\ncaused severe acute-on-chronic back pain for which she is \r\nreceiving opioids and benzodiazapines. Will receive Bactrim for \r\nPCP prophylaxis starting at discharge.\r\n\r\n# history of DVT: History of LLE DVTs, on Rivaroxaban at home \r\nand IVC filter in place. Rivaroxaban was held once Plt<75k in \r\nsetting of multi-line decline from decitabine.\r\n\r\n# common variable immunodeficiency: Patient had multiple IgG \r\nchecks for known CVID and did not require IVIG as inpatient.\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n- complete 6 week antibiotics: vancomycin, cefepime, \r\nmicafungin(d1 = ___, end ___, follow-up with OPAT\r\n- weekly labs: CBC with differential, BUN, Cr, Vancomycin\r\ntrough, AST, ALT (fax to ATTN: ___ CLINIC - FAX: \r\n___\r\n- repeat MR ___ 1 month after discharge\r\n- PCP prophylaxis with ___ SS daily\r\n- plan future decitabine with Dr. ___ team\r\n- plan for curative transplant with Dr. ___ team\r\n- continue to monitor L gluteal furuncle\r\n- consider restarting rivaroxaban when deemed appropriate \r\n(stopped inpatient due to thrombocytopenia)\r\n- Code: Full\r\n- Contact: ___ (husband) ___\r\n \r\nMedications on Admission:\r\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\r\n1.

She had an exhaustive \r\nworkup of her fevers, including skin and psoas biopsies, and \r\ntissue uPCR was sent, but there was no culture positivity or \r\npositive findings in her infectious workup. However, after \r\nconsultation with ID, it was decided to treat empirically for \r\npresumptive osteomyelitis/discitis with 6 weeks of vancomycin \r\n(750mg IV q12h), cefepime (2g IV q12h), micafungin (100 mg PO \r\nq24h). Micafungin was chosen instead of posaconazole due to \r\n___ differences; but she did receive posaconazole while \r\ninpatient. Simultaneously, the patient was having significantly \r\nworsened back pain after her MDS diagnosing bone marrow biopsy. \r\nShe was started on opioid pain control, which was uptitrated and \r\naugmented with Valium to good effect. She went home with BID \r\noxycontin, PRN oxycodone, and QHS Valium. She will follow-up as \r\noutpatient with Dr. ___.\r\n\r\n# Fever + neutropenia: The patient received 2 doses of \r\ndecitabine as outpatient prior to experiencing first fever of \r\n101 at home, then 100.4 in clinic during third dose decitabine \r\nadministration. She was admitted for fever in setting of \r\ncytoreduction, and she eventually became truly neutropenic. An \r\nexhaustive workup was performed, centering on MRI findings of \r\npotential osteomyelitis/discitis with potential L psoas \r\ninvovlvement. This tissue was biopsied, negative by culture, and \r\nuPCR pending at the time of discharge. The patient will be given \r\nempiric therapy of vancomycin/cefepime/micafungin for a total of \r\n6 weeks (___) and instructed to have 1 month follow-up \r\nspinal imaging. A LLE wound was also biopsied and grew nothing. \r\nBy exclusion, decitabine is thought to be the likely culprit of \r\nthe fever.\r\n\r\n# left gluteal furuncle: Formed at the marked site of the ___ L \r\npsoas biopsy. By ultrasound found to only have subcutaneous \r\nedema without fluid collection. This will be followed by patient \r\nand outpatient team as potential new nidus of infection if \r\nappearing worse or causing pain.\r\n\r\n# low back pain: Acute on chronic in this patient, who has \r\nbaseline degenerative changes. She also had R iliac crest bone \r\nmarrow biopsy prior to this admission which may have caused \r\nhematoma, inflammatory, or direct nerve injury which contributed \r\nto her severe pain. She was uptitrated to a pain regimen \r\nincluding standing Oxycontin BID, oxycodone PRN, and Valium QHS, \r\nwhich she was able to tolerate with good effect. She worked with \r\n___ and was deemed fit for discharge home with services.\r\n\r\n# treatment related MDS: Secondary to autoSCT with BEAM \r\nconditioning for DLBCL. Patient had bone marrow biopsy which \r\ndiagnosed new-onset treatment related MDS, but may have also \r\ncaused severe acute-on-chronic back pain for which she is \r\nreceiving opioids and benzodiazapines. Will receive Bactrim for \r\nPCP prophylaxis starting at discharge.\r\n\r\n# history of DVT: History of LLE DVTs, on Rivaroxaban at home \r\nand IVC filter in place. Rivaroxaban was held once Plt<75k in \r\nsetting of multi-line decline from decitabine.\r\n\r\n# common variable immunodeficiency: Patient had multiple IgG \r\nchecks for known CVID and did not require IVIG as inpatient.\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n- complete 6 week antibiotics: vancomycin, cefepime, \r\nmicafungin(d1 = ___, end ___, follow-up with OPAT\r\n- weekly labs: CBC with differential, BUN, Cr, Vancomycin\r\ntrough, AST, ALT (fax to ATTN: ___ CLINIC - FAX: \r\n___\r\n- repeat MR ___ 1 month after discharge\r\n- PCP prophylaxis with ___ SS daily\r\n- plan future decitabine with Dr. ___ team\r\n- plan for curative transplant with Dr. ___ team\r\n- continue to monitor L gluteal furuncle\r\n- consider restarting rivaroxaban when deemed appropriate \r\n(stopped inpatient due to thrombocytopenia)\r\n- Code: Full\r\n- Contact: ___ (husband) ___\r\n \r\nMedications on Admission:\r\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\r\n1.

Evaluate for hemorrhage. \r\n  \r\nTECHNIQUE:  Sagittal and axial T1 weighted imaging were \r\nperformed. After \r\nadministration of 11 mL of Gadavist intravenous contrast, axial \r\nimaging was \r\nperformed with gradient echo, FLAIR, diffusion, and T1 \r\ntechnique. Sagittal \r\nMPRAGE imaging was performed and re-formatted in axial and \r\ncoronal \r\norientations. \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  CT head ___ \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nThere is no evidence of acute infarction, or intracranial \r\nhemorrhage.  The \r\nventricles are normal in size without mass effect or midline \r\nshift.  There is \r\nno abnormal enhancement, enhancing mass, or leptomeningeal \r\ndisease.  There is \r\nminimal nonspecific scattered foci of hyperintense T2/FLAIR \r\nsignal changes \r\nwithin the subcortical and periventricular white matter, which \r\nis likely a \r\nsequela of chronic small vessel microangiopathy.  The dural \r\nvenous sinuses \r\nappear patent on post-contrast MPRAGE images.  The paranasal \r\nsinuses appear \r\nclear.  The bilateral mastoid air cells appear unremarkable.  \r\nThe orbits and \r\nvisualized soft tissues appear unremarkable. \r\n  \r\nIMPRESSION: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n1. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, acute infarction, \r\nedema, or \r\nabnormal enhancement. \r\n\r\nEXAMINATION:  MR ___ AND W/O CONTRAST ___ MR SPINE \r\n  \r\nINDICATION:  ___ year old woman with transformed follicular \r\nlymphoma and h/o \r\nCLL s/p auto SCT in ___ in remission from lymphoma standpoint \r\nbut developed \r\ntreatment related MDS, receiving Dacogen who developed \r\nneutropenic fevers and \r\nMRI on ___ showed ? early discitis and L psoas abnormality \r\nnow 5 weeks \r\ninto antibiotics.  // Evaluate for the evolution of theL4-L5 \r\nprocess involving \r\nendplates and L psoas muscle  ___ year old woman with transformed \r\nfollicular \r\nlymphoma and h/o CLL s/p auto SCT in ___ in remission from \r\nlymphoma \r\nstandpoint but developed treatment related MDS, receiving \r\nDacogen who \r\ndeveloped neutropenic fevers and MRI on ___ showed ? early \r\ndiscitis and L \r\npsoas abnormality now 5 weeks into antibiotics.  // Evaluate for \r\nthe evolution \r\nof theL4-L5 process involving endplates and L psoas muscle   \r\nEvaluate for the \r\nevolution of theL4-L5 process involving endplates and L psoas \r\nmuscle \r\n  \r\nTECHNIQUE:  Sagittal imaging was performed with T2, T1, and STIR \r\ntechnique, \r\nfollowed by axial T2 imaging. This was followed by sagittal and \r\naxial T1 \r\nimages obtained after the uneventful intravenous administration \r\nof 11 mL of \r\nGadavist  contrast agent. \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  Lumbar spine MR examinations ___ and ___.  \r\nCT abdomen and pelvis ___. \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nAgain seen is scoliosis convex to the left in the upper lumbar \r\nspine and to \r\nthe right in the lower lumbar spine.  Again seen is anterior \r\nsubluxation of L5 \r\non S1.  Again seen is ___ type 1 signal intensity change at \r\nL2-3.  This \r\nincludes a low signal of the vertebral endplates on the T1 \r\nweighted images and \r\nhigh signal of these endplates on the STIR images.  This finding \r\nhas not \r\nchanged since ___. \r\n  \r\nNew since ___ but unchanged since ___ are \r\nsimilar changes \r\nat the L4-5 interspace.  There is low signal of the endplates on \r\nthe T1 \r\nweighted images and high signal on the STIR images.  All of the \r\nlumbar discs \r\nare hypointense on the T2 weighted and STIR images as are the \r\ndiscs at the T9 \r\nthrough T12 level.  These are further manifestations of \r\ndegenerative disc \r\ndisease.  The endplates at L2-3 and at L4-5 enhance after \r\ncontrast \r\nadministration.  This is typical ___ type 1 change.  The \r\nintervertebral \r\ndiscs themselves do not enhance after contrast administration. \r\n  \r\nAgain seen are hypointensities in the intervertebral discs at \r\nmultiple levels. \r\nCorrelation with the CT abdomen and pelvis of ___ \r\ndemonstrates \r\nthat at every level from L2 through S1 included a vacuum \r\nphenomenon in the \r\nintervertebral disc. \r\n  \r\nThere is no evidence of abnormal intraspinal \r\ncontrast-enhancement. \r\n  \r\nThe psoas and spinal erector muscles are asymmetric and \r\ndemonstrate fatty \r\natrophy bilaterally. These changes are likely a result of the \r\nscoliosis.  Much \r\nof the hyperintensity seen on the pre and postcontrast axial T1 \r\nweighted \r\nimages through the medial portion of the left psoas muscle at \r\nthe lower L4 \r\nlevel is due to the fatty atrophy, rather than enhancement.  It \r\nis unclear \r\nwhether there is any abnormal enhancement of the left psoas \r\nmuscle, if so, it \r\nis minimal. \r\n  \r\nHypointensity on the T1 weighted images with enhancement after \r\ncontrast \r\nadministration involves the left side of the superior portion of \r\nthe L5 \r\nvertebral body and extends through the pedicle into the facet \r\njoint.  This \r\ncorrelates with mild hyperintensity in these regions on the STIR \r\nimages.  \r\nThere is slight induration of the adjacent fat between the \r\nvertebral body and \r\nthe psoas muscle, best seen on image 30 of series 7 with \r\nenhancement seen on \r\nimage 30 of series 9.  These findings may represent further \r\ninflammatory \r\nchange due to degenerative disease, or a local focus of \r\ninfection.  Note that \r\nthis appearance is quite similar to that of the ___ \r\nstudy.  The CT \r\nscans through the left facet joint at this level consistently \r\ndemonstrated a \r\nvacuum phenomenon, arguing strongly against infection of the \r\njoint.  There is \r\nno evidence of bone destruction on the CT scans, which would be \r\nhighly unusual \r\nif there were chronic osteomyelitis extending as far back as \r\n___.  \r\nThere is similar mild enhancement posteriorly along the left \r\nlamina at this \r\nlevel.  Overall, these findings again are more likely due to \r\ninflammatory \r\ndegenerative disease than infection. \r\n  \r\nThe combination of vacuum phenomenon, low signal of the disc on \r\nthe T2 \r\nweighted images, ___ type 1 signal intensity changes of the \r\nendplates and \r\nstability over time all argue in favor of degenerative disc \r\ndisease as the \r\ncause of these changes.  This constellation of findings would be \r\nextremely \r\nunlikely in the setting of discitis. \r\n  \r\nThere is a mild bulge of the T11-12 disc with no encroachment on \r\nthe spinal \r\ncord or neural foramina. \r\n  \r\nAt T12-L1 there is no encroachment on the cord or foramina.  \r\nIncidentally \r\nnoted is an apparent right renal cyst, better evaluated on the \r\nrecent CT scan. \r\nThere is a small midline and right-sided protrusion of the \r\nintervertebral disc \r\nthat extends superiorly along the posterior margin of the L1 \r\nvertebral body.  \r\nThis does not contact the nerve roots.  The neural foramina \r\nappear normal. \r\n  \r\nAt L1-2 there is a small midline and right-sided disc protrusion \r\nthat \r\nencroaches on the thecal sac but does not contact the nerve \r\nroots.  This \r\nfragment extends superiorly along the posterior margin of the L1 \r\nbody.  The \r\nneural foramina appear normal. \r\n  \r\nAt L2-3, bulging of the disc and facet osteophytes produce \r\nencroachment on the \r\ntraversing L3 nerve roots bilaterally.  There is narrowing of \r\nthe right neural \r\nforamen due to facet osteophytes and intervertebral osteophytes. \r\n\r\n  \r\nAt L3-4, disc bulging and intervertebral osteophytes contact the \r\ntraversing \r\nright L4 nerve root.  The neural foramina are moderately \r\nnarrowed bilaterally. \r\n  \r\nAt L4-5, there is disc bulging but no evidence of nerve root \r\ncompression \r\nwithin the spinal canal.  There are prominent facet osteophytes \r\nbilaterally \r\nthe produce severe left and moderate right \r\n  \r\nAt L5-S1, there is elongation of the spinal canal due to the \r\nsubluxation of L5 \r\non S1.  There are prominent facet osteophytes bilaterally.  The \r\ncombination of \r\nthese factors and loss of height of the intervertebral disc as \r\nwell as disc \r\nbulging produces moderate -severe narrowing of the neural \r\nforamina \r\nbilaterally. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIMPRESSION: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n1. As discussed above, the vertebral, intervertebral disc, facet \r\nand left \r\npsoas muscle findings are likely due to a combination of \r\nscoliosis and chronic \r\ndegenerative disc disease, likely with inflammation on this \r\nbasis. \r\n2. The minimal change over time, vacuum phenomenon in the \r\nintervertebral discs \r\nand facet joints, absence of bone destruction and pattern of \r\nsignal intensity \r\nabnormalities argue against infection as the etiology. \r\n3. Degenerative disc disease produces mild encroachment on \r\nseveral nerve roots \r\nand more severe narrowing of the neural foramina at several \r\nlevels. \r\n\r\nEXAMINATION:  TIB/FIB (AP AND LAT) LEFT \r\n  \r\nINDICATION:  ___ year old woman with LLE edema, phlebolith seen \r\non US  // \r\nphlebolith seen on US? \r\n  \r\nTECHNIQUE:  Left tibia, fibula two views \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  Ultrasound lower extremity ___ \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nLeft knee arthroplasty.

She is\r\ncurrently on C2D12 of treatment with decitabine and presents \r\nwith\r\none day of confusion and chills. Neutropenic and afebrile with \r\nno infectious source identified, improved rapidly to baseline on \r\n___ and IV antibiotics were deescalated. \r\n\r\n#Altered mental status: Presented with word finding difficulty \r\nand generalized malaise with decreased PO intake, without true \r\nglobal sensorium deficit. 1 month prior during hospitalization \r\nhad been diagnosed with presumed osteomyelitis though imaging \r\nwas equivocal, and started on 1 month broad spectrum ABX course. \r\nOn this admission, ___ c/f meningitis, cefepime was increased to \r\nmeningitis dosing and ampicillin was added. Her home vanc and \r\nmica were continued. On ___ ___ the patient rapidly improved and \r\nmental status and symptoms were back to her baseline. Urine \r\nculture drawn in the ED (taken in bed-pan, not sterile) grew \r\nEnteroccus faecium pan-resistant, including ampicillin and \r\nvancomycin. The organism was not sensitive to any of the \r\nantibiotics that she was on, thus the organism was not treated, \r\nhowever she improved to baseline as above. Thus the UTI was \r\nlikely not the source of her AMS. In this light, she was not \r\nsent out on further antibiotics, but was counseled to return to \r\nthe hospital if she developed urinary symptoms or more \r\nconfusion. The true etiology is unclear. It may have been a \r\nviral infection or possibly cerebral hypoperfusion in the \r\nsetting of vascular pathology (h/o aneurysms). \r\n\r\n#UTI: see above for urine culture growing Enterococcus faecium. \r\n\r\n#LLE edema: Had a history of DVTs and was previously on \r\nrivaroxaban but this had been held for some time ___ \r\nthrombocytopenia.

Evaluate for hemorrhage. \r\n  \r\nTECHNIQUE:  Sagittal and axial T1 weighted imaging were \r\nperformed. After \r\nadministration of 11 mL of Gadavist intravenous contrast, axial \r\nimaging was \r\nperformed with gradient echo, FLAIR, diffusion, and T1 \r\ntechnique. Sagittal \r\nMPRAGE imaging was performed and re-formatted in axial and \r\ncoronal \r\norientations. \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  CT head ___ \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nThere is no evidence of acute infarction, or intracranial \r\nhemorrhage.  The \r\nventricles are normal in size without mass effect or midline \r\nshift.  There is \r\nno abnormal enhancement, enhancing mass, or leptomeningeal \r\ndisease.  There is \r\nminimal nonspecific scattered foci of hyperintense T2/FLAIR \r\nsignal changes \r\nwithin the subcortical and periventricular white matter, which \r\nis likely a \r\nsequela of chronic small vessel microangiopathy.

This was followed by sagittal and \r\naxial T1 \r\nimages obtained after the uneventful intravenous administration \r\nof 11 mL of \r\nGadavist  contrast agent. \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  Lumbar spine MR examinations ___ and ___.  \r\nCT abdomen and pelvis ___. \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nAgain seen is scoliosis convex to the left in the upper lumbar \r\nspine and to \r\nthe right in the lower lumbar spine.  Again seen is anterior \r\nsubluxation of L5 \r\non S1.  Again seen is ___ type 1 signal intensity change at \r\nL2-3.  This \r\nincludes a low signal of the vertebral endplates on the T1 \r\nweighted images and \r\nhigh signal of these endplates on the STIR images.  This finding \r\nhas not \r\nchanged since ___. \r\n  \r\nNew since ___ but unchanged since ___ are \r\nsimilar changes \r\nat the L4-5 interspace.  There is low signal of the endplates on \r\nthe T1 \r\nweighted images and high signal on the STIR images.  All of the \r\nlumbar discs \r\nare hypointense on the T2 weighted and STIR images as are the \r\ndiscs at the T9 \r\nthrough T12 level.  These are further manifestations of \r\ndegenerative disc \r\ndisease.  The endplates at L2-3 and at L4-5 enhance after \r\ncontrast \r\nadministration.  This is typical ___ type 1 change.  The \r\nintervertebral \r\ndiscs themselves do not enhance after contrast administration. \r\n  \r\nAgain seen are hypointensities in the intervertebral discs at \r\nmultiple levels. \r\nCorrelation with the CT abdomen and pelvis of ___ \r\ndemonstrates \r\nthat at every level from L2 through S1 included a vacuum \r\nphenomenon in the \r\nintervertebral disc. \r\n  \r\nThere is no evidence of abnormal intraspinal \r\ncontrast-enhancement. \r\n  \r\nThe psoas and spinal erector muscles are asymmetric and \r\ndemonstrate fatty \r\natrophy bilaterally. These changes are likely a result of the \r\nscoliosis.  Much \r\nof the hyperintensity seen on the pre and postcontrast axial T1 \r\nweighted \r\nimages through the medial portion of the left psoas muscle at \r\nthe lower L4 \r\nlevel is due to the fatty atrophy, rather than enhancement.  It \r\nis unclear \r\nwhether there is any abnormal enhancement of the left psoas \r\nmuscle, if so, it \r\nis minimal. \r\n  \r\nHypointensity on the T1 weighted images with enhancement after \r\ncontrast \r\nadministration involves the left side of the superior portion of \r\nthe L5 \r\nvertebral body and extends through the pedicle into the facet \r\njoint.  This \r\ncorrelates with mild hyperintensity in these regions on the STIR \r\nimages.  \r\nThere is slight induration of the adjacent fat between the \r\nvertebral body and \r\nthe psoas muscle, best seen on image 30 of series 7 with \r\nenhancement seen on \r\nimage 30 of series 9.  These findings may represent further \r\ninflammatory \r\nchange due to degenerative disease, or a local focus of \r\ninfection.  Note that \r\nthis appearance is quite similar to that of the ___ \r\nstudy.  The CT \r\nscans through the left facet joint at this level consistently \r\ndemonstrated a \r\nvacuum phenomenon, arguing strongly against infection of the \r\njoint.  There is \r\nno evidence of bone destruction on the CT scans, which would be \r\nhighly unusual \r\nif there were chronic osteomyelitis extending as far back as \r\n___.  \r\nThere is similar mild enhancement posteriorly along the left \r\nlamina at this \r\nlevel.  Overall, these findings again are more likely due to \r\ninflammatory \r\ndegenerative disease than infection. \r\n  \r\nThe combination of vacuum phenomenon, low signal of the disc on \r\nthe T2 \r\nweighted images, ___ type 1 signal intensity changes of the \r\nendplates and \r\nstability over time all argue in favor of degenerative disc \r\ndisease as the \r\ncause of these changes.  This constellation of findings would be \r\nextremely \r\nunlikely in the setting of discitis. \r\n  \r\nThere is a mild bulge of the T11-12 disc with no encroachment on \r\nthe spinal \r\ncord or neural foramina. \r\n  \r\nAt T12-L1 there is no encroachment on the cord or foramina.  \r\nIncidentally \r\nnoted is an apparent right renal cyst, better evaluated on the \r\nrecent CT scan. \r\nThere is a small midline and right-sided protrusion of the \r\nintervertebral disc \r\nthat extends superiorly along the posterior margin of the L1 \r\nvertebral body.  \r\nThis does not contact the nerve roots.  The neural foramina \r\nappear normal. \r\n  \r\nAt L1-2 there is a small midline and right-sided disc protrusion \r\nthat \r\nencroaches on the thecal sac but does not contact the nerve \r\nroots.  This \r\nfragment extends superiorly along the posterior margin of the L1 \r\nbody.  The \r\nneural foramina appear normal. \r\n  \r\nAt L2-3, bulging of the disc and facet osteophytes produce \r\nencroachment on the \r\ntraversing L3 nerve roots bilaterally.  There is narrowing of \r\nthe right neural \r\nforamen due to facet osteophytes and intervertebral osteophytes. \r\n\r\n  \r\nAt L3-4, disc bulging and intervertebral osteophytes contact the \r\ntraversing \r\nright L4 nerve root.  The neural foramina are moderately \r\nnarrowed bilaterally. \r\n  \r\nAt L4-5, there is disc bulging but no evidence of nerve root \r\ncompression \r\nwithin the spinal canal.  There are prominent facet osteophytes \r\nbilaterally \r\nthe produce severe left and moderate right \r\n  \r\nAt L5-S1, there is elongation of the spinal canal due to the \r\nsubluxation of L5 \r\non S1.  There are prominent facet osteophytes bilaterally.  The \r\ncombination of \r\nthese factors and loss of height of the intervertebral disc as \r\nwell as disc \r\nbulging produces moderate -severe narrowing of the neural \r\nforamina \r\nbilaterally. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIMPRESSION: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n1. As discussed above, the vertebral, intervertebral disc, facet \r\nand left \r\npsoas muscle findings are likely due to a combination of \r\nscoliosis and chronic \r\ndegenerative disc disease, likely with inflammation on this \r\nbasis. \r\n2. The minimal change over time, vacuum phenomenon in the \r\nintervertebral discs \r\nand facet joints, absence of bone destruction and pattern of \r\nsignal intensity \r\nabnormalities argue against infection as the etiology. \r\n3. Degenerative disc disease produces mild encroachment on \r\nseveral nerve roots \r\nand more severe narrowing of the neural foramina at several \r\nlevels. \r\n\r\nEXAMINATION:  TIB/FIB (AP AND LAT) LEFT \r\n  \r\nINDICATION:  ___ year old woman with LLE edema, phlebolith seen \r\non US  // \r\nphlebolith seen on US? \r\n  \r\nTECHNIQUE:  Left tibia, fibula two views \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  Ultrasound lower extremity ___ \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nLeft knee arthroplasty.

Neutropenic and afebrile with \r\nno infectious source identified, improved rapidly to baseline on \r\n___ and IV antibiotics were deescalated. \r\n\r\n#Altered mental status: Presented with word finding difficulty \r\nand generalized malaise with decreased PO intake, without true \r\nglobal sensorium deficit. 1 month prior during hospitalization \r\nhad been diagnosed with presumed osteomyelitis though imaging \r\nwas equivocal, and started on 1 month broad spectrum ABX course. \r\nOn this admission, ___ c/f meningitis, cefepime was increased to \r\nmeningitis dosing and ampicillin was added. Her home vanc and \r\nmica were continued. On ___ ___ the patient rapidly improved and \r\nmental status and symptoms were back to her baseline. Urine \r\nculture drawn in the ED (taken in bed-pan, not sterile) grew \r\nEnteroccus faecium pan-resistant, including ampicillin and \r\nvancomycin. The organism was not sensitive to any of the \r\nantibiotics that she was on, thus the organism was not treated, \r\nhowever she improved to baseline as above. Thus the UTI was \r\nlikely not the source of her AMS. In this light, she was not \r\nsent out on further antibiotics, but was counseled to return to \r\nthe hospital if she developed urinary symptoms or more \r\nconfusion. The true etiology is unclear. It may have been a \r\nviral infection or possibly cerebral hypoperfusion in the \r\nsetting of vascular pathology (h/o aneurysms). \r\n\r\n#UTI: see above for urine culture growing Enterococcus faecium. \r\n\r\n#LLE edema: Had a history of DVTs and was previously on \r\nrivaroxaban but this had been held for some time ___ \r\nthrombocytopenia.

Evaluate for hemorrhage. \r\n  \r\nTECHNIQUE:  Sagittal and axial T1 weighted imaging were \r\nperformed. After \r\nadministration of 11 mL of Gadavist intravenous contrast, axial \r\nimaging was \r\nperformed with gradient echo, FLAIR, diffusion, and T1 \r\ntechnique. Sagittal \r\nMPRAGE imaging was performed and re-formatted in axial and \r\ncoronal \r\norientations. \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  CT head ___ \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nThere is no evidence of acute infarction, or intracranial \r\nhemorrhage.  The \r\nventricles are normal in size without mass effect or midline \r\nshift.  There is \r\nno abnormal enhancement, enhancing mass, or leptomeningeal \r\ndisease.  There is \r\nminimal nonspecific scattered foci of hyperintense T2/FLAIR \r\nsignal changes \r\nwithin the subcortical and periventricular white matter, which \r\nis likely a \r\nsequela of chronic small vessel microangiopathy.  The dural \r\nvenous sinuses \r\nappear patent on post-contrast MPRAGE images.  The paranasal \r\nsinuses appear \r\nclear.

This was followed by sagittal and \r\naxial T1 \r\nimages obtained after the uneventful intravenous administration \r\nof 11 mL of \r\nGadavist  contrast agent. \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  Lumbar spine MR examinations ___ and ___.  \r\nCT abdomen and pelvis ___. \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nAgain seen is scoliosis convex to the left in the upper lumbar \r\nspine and to \r\nthe right in the lower lumbar spine.  Again seen is anterior \r\nsubluxation of L5 \r\non S1.  Again seen is ___ type 1 signal intensity change at \r\nL2-3.  This \r\nincludes a low signal of the vertebral endplates on the T1 \r\nweighted images and \r\nhigh signal of these endplates on the STIR images.  This finding \r\nhas not \r\nchanged since ___. \r\n  \r\nNew since ___ but unchanged since ___ are \r\nsimilar changes \r\nat the L4-5 interspace.  There is low signal of the endplates on \r\nthe T1 \r\nweighted images and high signal on the STIR images.  All of the \r\nlumbar discs \r\nare hypointense on the T2 weighted and STIR images as are the \r\ndiscs at the T9 \r\nthrough T12 level.  These are further manifestations of \r\ndegenerative disc \r\ndisease.  The endplates at L2-3 and at L4-5 enhance after \r\ncontrast \r\nadministration.  This is typical ___ type 1 change.  The \r\nintervertebral \r\ndiscs themselves do not enhance after contrast administration. \r\n  \r\nAgain seen are hypointensities in the intervertebral discs at \r\nmultiple levels. \r\nCorrelation with the CT abdomen and pelvis of ___ \r\ndemonstrates \r\nthat at every level from L2 through S1 included a vacuum \r\nphenomenon in the \r\nintervertebral disc. \r\n  \r\nThere is no evidence of abnormal intraspinal \r\ncontrast-enhancement. \r\n  \r\nThe psoas and spinal erector muscles are asymmetric and \r\ndemonstrate fatty \r\natrophy bilaterally. These changes are likely a result of the \r\nscoliosis.  Much \r\nof the hyperintensity seen on the pre and postcontrast axial T1 \r\nweighted \r\nimages through the medial portion of the left psoas muscle at \r\nthe lower L4 \r\nlevel is due to the fatty atrophy, rather than enhancement.  It \r\nis unclear \r\nwhether there is any abnormal enhancement of the left psoas \r\nmuscle, if so, it \r\nis minimal. \r\n  \r\nHypointensity on the T1 weighted images with enhancement after \r\ncontrast \r\nadministration involves the left side of the superior portion of \r\nthe L5 \r\nvertebral body and extends through the pedicle into the facet \r\njoint.  This \r\ncorrelates with mild hyperintensity in these regions on the STIR \r\nimages.  \r\nThere is slight induration of the adjacent fat between the \r\nvertebral body and \r\nthe psoas muscle, best seen on image 30 of series 7 with \r\nenhancement seen on \r\nimage 30 of series 9.  These findings may represent further \r\ninflammatory \r\nchange due to degenerative disease, or a local focus of \r\ninfection.  Note that \r\nthis appearance is quite similar to that of the ___ \r\nstudy.  The CT \r\nscans through the left facet joint at this level consistently \r\ndemonstrated a \r\nvacuum phenomenon, arguing strongly against infection of the \r\njoint.  There is \r\nno evidence of bone destruction on the CT scans, which would be \r\nhighly unusual \r\nif there were chronic osteomyelitis extending as far back as \r\n___.  \r\nThere is similar mild enhancement posteriorly along the left \r\nlamina at this \r\nlevel.  Overall, these findings again are more likely due to \r\ninflammatory \r\ndegenerative disease than infection. \r\n  \r\nThe combination of vacuum phenomenon, low signal of the disc on \r\nthe T2 \r\nweighted images, ___ type 1 signal intensity changes of the \r\nendplates and \r\nstability over time all argue in favor of degenerative disc \r\ndisease as the \r\ncause of these changes.  This constellation of findings would be \r\nextremely \r\nunlikely in the setting of discitis. \r\n  \r\nThere is a mild bulge of the T11-12 disc with no encroachment on \r\nthe spinal \r\ncord or neural foramina. \r\n  \r\nAt T12-L1 there is no encroachment on the cord or foramina.  \r\nIncidentally \r\nnoted is an apparent right renal cyst, better evaluated on the \r\nrecent CT scan. \r\nThere is a small midline and right-sided protrusion of the \r\nintervertebral disc \r\nthat extends superiorly along the posterior margin of the L1 \r\nvertebral body.  \r\nThis does not contact the nerve roots.  The neural foramina \r\nappear normal. \r\n  \r\nAt L1-2 there is a small midline and right-sided disc protrusion \r\nthat \r\nencroaches on the thecal sac but does not contact the nerve \r\nroots.  This \r\nfragment extends superiorly along the posterior margin of the L1 \r\nbody.  The \r\nneural foramina appear normal. \r\n  \r\nAt L2-3, bulging of the disc and facet osteophytes produce \r\nencroachment on the \r\ntraversing L3 nerve roots bilaterally.  There is narrowing of \r\nthe right neural \r\nforamen due to facet osteophytes and intervertebral osteophytes. \r\n\r\n  \r\nAt L3-4, disc bulging and intervertebral osteophytes contact the \r\ntraversing \r\nright L4 nerve root.  The neural foramina are moderately \r\nnarrowed bilaterally. \r\n  \r\nAt L4-5, there is disc bulging but no evidence of nerve root \r\ncompression \r\nwithin the spinal canal.  There are prominent facet osteophytes \r\nbilaterally \r\nthe produce severe left and moderate right \r\n  \r\nAt L5-S1, there is elongation of the spinal canal due to the \r\nsubluxation of L5 \r\non S1.  There are prominent facet osteophytes bilaterally.  The \r\ncombination of \r\nthese factors and loss of height of the intervertebral disc as \r\nwell as disc \r\nbulging produces moderate -severe narrowing of the neural \r\nforamina \r\nbilaterally. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIMPRESSION: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n1. As discussed above, the vertebral, intervertebral disc, facet \r\nand left \r\npsoas muscle findings are likely due to a combination of \r\nscoliosis and chronic \r\ndegenerative disc disease, likely with inflammation on this \r\nbasis. \r\n2. The minimal change over time, vacuum phenomenon in the \r\nintervertebral discs \r\nand facet joints, absence of bone destruction and pattern of \r\nsignal intensity \r\nabnormalities argue against infection as the etiology. \r\n3. Degenerative disc disease produces mild encroachment on \r\nseveral nerve roots \r\nand more severe narrowing of the neural foramina at several \r\nlevels. \r\n\r\nEXAMINATION:  TIB/FIB (AP AND LAT) LEFT \r\n  \r\nINDICATION:  ___ year old woman with LLE edema, phlebolith seen \r\non US  // \r\nphlebolith seen on US? \r\n  \r\nTECHNIQUE:  Left tibia, fibula two views \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  Ultrasound lower extremity ___ \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nLeft knee arthroplasty.

She is\r\ncurrently on C2D12 of treatment with decitabine and presents \r\nwith\r\none day of confusion and chills. Neutropenic and afebrile with \r\nno infectious source identified, improved rapidly to baseline on \r\n___ and IV antibiotics were deescalated. \r\n\r\n#Altered mental status: Presented with word finding difficulty \r\nand generalized malaise with decreased PO intake, without true \r\nglobal sensorium deficit. 1 month prior during hospitalization \r\nhad been diagnosed with presumed osteomyelitis though imaging \r\nwas equivocal, and started on 1 month broad spectrum ABX course. \r\nOn this admission, ___ c/f meningitis, cefepime was increased to \r\nmeningitis dosing and ampicillin was added. Her home vanc and \r\nmica were continued. On ___ ___ the patient rapidly improved and \r\nmental status and symptoms were back to her baseline. Urine \r\nculture drawn in the ED (taken in bed-pan, not sterile) grew \r\nEnteroccus faecium pan-resistant, including ampicillin and \r\nvancomycin. The organism was not sensitive to any of the \r\nantibiotics that she was on, thus the organism was not treated, \r\nhowever she improved to baseline as above. Thus the UTI was \r\nlikely not the source of her AMS. In this light, she was not \r\nsent out on further antibiotics, but was counseled to return to \r\nthe hospital if she developed urinary symptoms or more \r\nconfusion. The true etiology is unclear. It may have been a \r\nviral infection or possibly cerebral hypoperfusion in the \r\nsetting of vascular pathology (h/o aneurysms). \r\n\r\n#UTI: see above for urine culture growing Enterococcus faecium. \r\n\r\n#LLE edema: Had a history of DVTs and was previously on \r\nrivaroxaban but this had been held for some time ___ \r\nthrombocytopenia.

Evaluate for hemorrhage. \r\n  \r\nTECHNIQUE:  Sagittal and axial T1 weighted imaging were \r\nperformed. After \r\nadministration of 11 mL of Gadavist intravenous contrast, axial \r\nimaging was \r\nperformed with gradient echo, FLAIR, diffusion, and T1 \r\ntechnique. Sagittal \r\nMPRAGE imaging was performed and re-formatted in axial and \r\ncoronal \r\norientations. \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  CT head ___ \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nThere is no evidence of acute infarction, or intracranial \r\nhemorrhage.  The \r\nventricles are normal in size without mass effect or midline \r\nshift.  There is \r\nno abnormal enhancement, enhancing mass, or leptomeningeal \r\ndisease.  There is \r\nminimal nonspecific scattered foci of hyperintense T2/FLAIR \r\nsignal changes \r\nwithin the subcortical and periventricular white matter, which \r\nis likely a \r\nsequela of chronic small vessel microangiopathy.

This was followed by sagittal and \r\naxial T1 \r\nimages obtained after the uneventful intravenous administration \r\nof 11 mL of \r\nGadavist  contrast agent. \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  Lumbar spine MR examinations ___ and ___.  \r\nCT abdomen and pelvis ___. \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nAgain seen is scoliosis convex to the left in the upper lumbar \r\nspine and to \r\nthe right in the lower lumbar spine.  Again seen is anterior \r\nsubluxation of L5 \r\non S1.  Again seen is ___ type 1 signal intensity change at \r\nL2-3.  This \r\nincludes a low signal of the vertebral endplates on the T1 \r\nweighted images and \r\nhigh signal of these endplates on the STIR images.  This finding \r\nhas not \r\nchanged since ___. \r\n  \r\nNew since ___ but unchanged since ___ are \r\nsimilar changes \r\nat the L4-5 interspace.  There is low signal of the endplates on \r\nthe T1 \r\nweighted images and high signal on the STIR images.  All of the \r\nlumbar discs \r\nare hypointense on the T2 weighted and STIR images as are the \r\ndiscs at the T9 \r\nthrough T12 level.  These are further manifestations of \r\ndegenerative disc \r\ndisease.  The endplates at L2-3 and at L4-5 enhance after \r\ncontrast \r\nadministration.  This is typical ___ type 1 change.  The \r\nintervertebral \r\ndiscs themselves do not enhance after contrast administration. \r\n  \r\nAgain seen are hypointensities in the intervertebral discs at \r\nmultiple levels. \r\nCorrelation with the CT abdomen and pelvis of ___ \r\ndemonstrates \r\nthat at every level from L2 through S1 included a vacuum \r\nphenomenon in the \r\nintervertebral disc. \r\n  \r\nThere is no evidence of abnormal intraspinal \r\ncontrast-enhancement. \r\n  \r\nThe psoas and spinal erector muscles are asymmetric and \r\ndemonstrate fatty \r\natrophy bilaterally. These changes are likely a result of the \r\nscoliosis.  Much \r\nof the hyperintensity seen on the pre and postcontrast axial T1 \r\nweighted \r\nimages through the medial portion of the left psoas muscle at \r\nthe lower L4 \r\nlevel is due to the fatty atrophy, rather than enhancement.  It \r\nis unclear \r\nwhether there is any abnormal enhancement of the left psoas \r\nmuscle, if so, it \r\nis minimal. \r\n  \r\nHypointensity on the T1 weighted images with enhancement after \r\ncontrast \r\nadministration involves the left side of the superior portion of \r\nthe L5 \r\nvertebral body and extends through the pedicle into the facet \r\njoint.  This \r\ncorrelates with mild hyperintensity in these regions on the STIR \r\nimages.  \r\nThere is slight induration of the adjacent fat between the \r\nvertebral body and \r\nthe psoas muscle, best seen on image 30 of series 7 with \r\nenhancement seen on \r\nimage 30 of series 9.  These findings may represent further \r\ninflammatory \r\nchange due to degenerative disease, or a local focus of \r\ninfection.  Note that \r\nthis appearance is quite similar to that of the ___ \r\nstudy.  The CT \r\nscans through the left facet joint at this level consistently \r\ndemonstrated a \r\nvacuum phenomenon, arguing strongly against infection of the \r\njoint.  There is \r\nno evidence of bone destruction on the CT scans, which would be \r\nhighly unusual \r\nif there were chronic osteomyelitis extending as far back as \r\n___.  \r\nThere is similar mild enhancement posteriorly along the left \r\nlamina at this \r\nlevel.  Overall, these findings again are more likely due to \r\ninflammatory \r\ndegenerative disease than infection. \r\n  \r\nThe combination of vacuum phenomenon, low signal of the disc on \r\nthe T2 \r\nweighted images, ___ type 1 signal intensity changes of the \r\nendplates and \r\nstability over time all argue in favor of degenerative disc \r\ndisease as the \r\ncause of these changes.  This constellation of findings would be \r\nextremely \r\nunlikely in the setting of discitis. \r\n  \r\nThere is a mild bulge of the T11-12 disc with no encroachment on \r\nthe spinal \r\ncord or neural foramina. \r\n  \r\nAt T12-L1 there is no encroachment on the cord or foramina.  \r\nIncidentally \r\nnoted is an apparent right renal cyst, better evaluated on the \r\nrecent CT scan. \r\nThere is a small midline and right-sided protrusion of the \r\nintervertebral disc \r\nthat extends superiorly along the posterior margin of the L1 \r\nvertebral body.  \r\nThis does not contact the nerve roots.  The neural foramina \r\nappear normal. \r\n  \r\nAt L1-2 there is a small midline and right-sided disc protrusion \r\nthat \r\nencroaches on the thecal sac but does not contact the nerve \r\nroots.  This \r\nfragment extends superiorly along the posterior margin of the L1 \r\nbody.  The \r\nneural foramina appear normal. \r\n  \r\nAt L2-3, bulging of the disc and facet osteophytes produce \r\nencroachment on the \r\ntraversing L3 nerve roots bilaterally.  There is narrowing of \r\nthe right neural \r\nforamen due to facet osteophytes and intervertebral osteophytes. \r\n\r\n  \r\nAt L3-4, disc bulging and intervertebral osteophytes contact the \r\ntraversing \r\nright L4 nerve root.  The neural foramina are moderately \r\nnarrowed bilaterally. \r\n  \r\nAt L4-5, there is disc bulging but no evidence of nerve root \r\ncompression \r\nwithin the spinal canal.  There are prominent facet osteophytes \r\nbilaterally \r\nthe produce severe left and moderate right \r\n  \r\nAt L5-S1, there is elongation of the spinal canal due to the \r\nsubluxation of L5 \r\non S1.  There are prominent facet osteophytes bilaterally.  The \r\ncombination of \r\nthese factors and loss of height of the intervertebral disc as \r\nwell as disc \r\nbulging produces moderate -severe narrowing of the neural \r\nforamina \r\nbilaterally. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIMPRESSION: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n1. As discussed above, the vertebral, intervertebral disc, facet \r\nand left \r\npsoas muscle findings are likely due to a combination of \r\nscoliosis and chronic \r\ndegenerative disc disease, likely with inflammation on this \r\nbasis. \r\n2. The minimal change over time, vacuum phenomenon in the \r\nintervertebral discs \r\nand facet joints, absence of bone destruction and pattern of \r\nsignal intensity \r\nabnormalities argue against infection as the etiology. \r\n3. Degenerative disc disease produces mild encroachment on \r\nseveral nerve roots \r\nand more severe narrowing of the neural foramina at several \r\nlevels. \r\n\r\nEXAMINATION:  TIB/FIB (AP AND LAT) LEFT \r\n  \r\nINDICATION:  ___ year old woman with LLE edema, phlebolith seen \r\non US  // \r\nphlebolith seen on US? \r\n  \r\nTECHNIQUE:  Left tibia, fibula two views \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  Ultrasound lower extremity ___ \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nLeft knee arthroplasty.

Neutropenic and afebrile with \r\nno infectious source identified, improved rapidly to baseline on \r\n___ and IV antibiotics were deescalated. \r\n\r\n#Altered mental status: Presented with word finding difficulty \r\nand generalized malaise with decreased PO intake, without true \r\nglobal sensorium deficit. 1 month prior during hospitalization \r\nhad been diagnosed with presumed osteomyelitis though imaging \r\nwas equivocal, and started on 1 month broad spectrum ABX course. \r\nOn this admission, ___ c/f meningitis, cefepime was increased to \r\nmeningitis dosing and ampicillin was added. Her home vanc and \r\nmica were continued. On ___ ___ the patient rapidly improved and \r\nmental status and symptoms were back to her baseline. Urine \r\nculture drawn in the ED (taken in bed-pan, not sterile) grew \r\nEnteroccus faecium pan-resistant, including ampicillin and \r\nvancomycin. The organism was not sensitive to any of the \r\nantibiotics that she was on, thus the organism was not treated, \r\nhowever she improved to baseline as above. Thus the UTI was \r\nlikely not the source of her AMS. In this light, she was not \r\nsent out on further antibiotics, but was counseled to return to \r\nthe hospital if she developed urinary symptoms or more \r\nconfusion. The true etiology is unclear. It may have been a \r\nviral infection or possibly cerebral hypoperfusion in the \r\nsetting of vascular pathology (h/o aneurysms). \r\n\r\n#UTI: see above for urine culture growing Enterococcus faecium. \r\n\r\n#LLE edema: Had a history of DVTs and was previously on \r\nrivaroxaban but this had been held for some time ___ \r\nthrombocytopenia.

After \r\nadministration of 11 mL of Gadavist intravenous contrast, axial \r\nimaging was \r\nperformed with gradient echo, FLAIR, diffusion, and T1 \r\ntechnique. Sagittal \r\nMPRAGE imaging was performed and re-formatted in axial and \r\ncoronal \r\norientations. \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  CT head ___ \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nThere is no evidence of acute infarction, or intracranial \r\nhemorrhage.  The \r\nventricles are normal in size without mass effect or midline \r\nshift.  There is \r\nno abnormal enhancement, enhancing mass, or leptomeningeal \r\ndisease.  There is \r\nminimal nonspecific scattered foci of hyperintense T2/FLAIR \r\nsignal changes \r\nwithin the subcortical and periventricular white matter, which \r\nis likely a \r\nsequela of chronic small vessel microangiopathy.

This was followed by sagittal and \r\naxial T1 \r\nimages obtained after the uneventful intravenous administration \r\nof 11 mL of \r\nGadavist  contrast agent. \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  Lumbar spine MR examinations ___ and ___.  \r\nCT abdomen and pelvis ___. \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nAgain seen is scoliosis convex to the left in the upper lumbar \r\nspine and to \r\nthe right in the lower lumbar spine.  Again seen is anterior \r\nsubluxation of L5 \r\non S1.  Again seen is ___ type 1 signal intensity change at \r\nL2-3.  This \r\nincludes a low signal of the vertebral endplates on the T1 \r\nweighted images and \r\nhigh signal of these endplates on the STIR images.  This finding \r\nhas not \r\nchanged since ___. \r\n  \r\nNew since ___ but unchanged since ___ are \r\nsimilar changes \r\nat the L4-5 interspace.  There is low signal of the endplates on \r\nthe T1 \r\nweighted images and high signal on the STIR images.  All of the \r\nlumbar discs \r\nare hypointense on the T2 weighted and STIR images as are the \r\ndiscs at the T9 \r\nthrough T12 level.  These are further manifestations of \r\ndegenerative disc \r\ndisease.  The endplates at L2-3 and at L4-5 enhance after \r\ncontrast \r\nadministration.  This is typical ___ type 1 change.  The \r\nintervertebral \r\ndiscs themselves do not enhance after contrast administration. \r\n  \r\nAgain seen are hypointensities in the intervertebral discs at \r\nmultiple levels. \r\nCorrelation with the CT abdomen and pelvis of ___ \r\ndemonstrates \r\nthat at every level from L2 through S1 included a vacuum \r\nphenomenon in the \r\nintervertebral disc. \r\n  \r\nThere is no evidence of abnormal intraspinal \r\ncontrast-enhancement. \r\n  \r\nThe psoas and spinal erector muscles are asymmetric and \r\ndemonstrate fatty \r\natrophy bilaterally. These changes are likely a result of the \r\nscoliosis.  Much \r\nof the hyperintensity seen on the pre and postcontrast axial T1 \r\nweighted \r\nimages through the medial portion of the left psoas muscle at \r\nthe lower L4 \r\nlevel is due to the fatty atrophy, rather than enhancement.  It \r\nis unclear \r\nwhether there is any abnormal enhancement of the left psoas \r\nmuscle, if so, it \r\nis minimal. \r\n  \r\nHypointensity on the T1 weighted images with enhancement after \r\ncontrast \r\nadministration involves the left side of the superior portion of \r\nthe L5 \r\nvertebral body and extends through the pedicle into the facet \r\njoint.  This \r\ncorrelates with mild hyperintensity in these regions on the STIR \r\nimages.  \r\nThere is slight induration of the adjacent fat between the \r\nvertebral body and \r\nthe psoas muscle, best seen on image 30 of series 7 with \r\nenhancement seen on \r\nimage 30 of series 9.  These findings may represent further \r\ninflammatory \r\nchange due to degenerative disease, or a local focus of \r\ninfection.  Note that \r\nthis appearance is quite similar to that of the ___ \r\nstudy.  The CT \r\nscans through the left facet joint at this level consistently \r\ndemonstrated a \r\nvacuum phenomenon, arguing strongly against infection of the \r\njoint.  There is \r\nno evidence of bone destruction on the CT scans, which would be \r\nhighly unusual \r\nif there were chronic osteomyelitis extending as far back as \r\n___.  \r\nThere is similar mild enhancement posteriorly along the left \r\nlamina at this \r\nlevel.  Overall, these findings again are more likely due to \r\ninflammatory \r\ndegenerative disease than infection. \r\n  \r\nThe combination of vacuum phenomenon, low signal of the disc on \r\nthe T2 \r\nweighted images, ___ type 1 signal intensity changes of the \r\nendplates and \r\nstability over time all argue in favor of degenerative disc \r\ndisease as the \r\ncause of these changes.  This constellation of findings would be \r\nextremely \r\nunlikely in the setting of discitis. \r\n  \r\nThere is a mild bulge of the T11-12 disc with no encroachment on \r\nthe spinal \r\ncord or neural foramina. \r\n  \r\nAt T12-L1 there is no encroachment on the cord or foramina.  \r\nIncidentally \r\nnoted is an apparent right renal cyst, better evaluated on the \r\nrecent CT scan. \r\nThere is a small midline and right-sided protrusion of the \r\nintervertebral disc \r\nthat extends superiorly along the posterior margin of the L1 \r\nvertebral body.  \r\nThis does not contact the nerve roots.  The neural foramina \r\nappear normal. \r\n  \r\nAt L1-2 there is a small midline and right-sided disc protrusion \r\nthat \r\nencroaches on the thecal sac but does not contact the nerve \r\nroots.  This \r\nfragment extends superiorly along the posterior margin of the L1 \r\nbody.  The \r\nneural foramina appear normal. \r\n  \r\nAt L2-3, bulging of the disc and facet osteophytes produce \r\nencroachment on the \r\ntraversing L3 nerve roots bilaterally.  There is narrowing of \r\nthe right neural \r\nforamen due to facet osteophytes and intervertebral osteophytes. \r\n\r\n  \r\nAt L3-4, disc bulging and intervertebral osteophytes contact the \r\ntraversing \r\nright L4 nerve root.  The neural foramina are moderately \r\nnarrowed bilaterally. \r\n  \r\nAt L4-5, there is disc bulging but no evidence of nerve root \r\ncompression \r\nwithin the spinal canal.  There are prominent facet osteophytes \r\nbilaterally \r\nthe produce severe left and moderate right \r\n  \r\nAt L5-S1, there is elongation of the spinal canal due to the \r\nsubluxation of L5 \r\non S1.  There are prominent facet osteophytes bilaterally.  The \r\ncombination of \r\nthese factors and loss of height of the intervertebral disc as \r\nwell as disc \r\nbulging produces moderate -severe narrowing of the neural \r\nforamina \r\nbilaterally. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIMPRESSION: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n1. As discussed above, the vertebral, intervertebral disc, facet \r\nand left \r\npsoas muscle findings are likely due to a combination of \r\nscoliosis and chronic \r\ndegenerative disc disease, likely with inflammation on this \r\nbasis. \r\n2. The minimal change over time, vacuum phenomenon in the \r\nintervertebral discs \r\nand facet joints, absence of bone destruction and pattern of \r\nsignal intensity \r\nabnormalities argue against infection as the etiology. \r\n3. Degenerative disc disease produces mild encroachment on \r\nseveral nerve roots \r\nand more severe narrowing of the neural foramina at several \r\nlevels. \r\n\r\nEXAMINATION:  TIB/FIB (AP AND LAT) LEFT \r\n  \r\nINDICATION:  ___ year old woman with LLE edema, phlebolith seen \r\non US  // \r\nphlebolith seen on US? \r\n  \r\nTECHNIQUE:  Left tibia, fibula two views \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  Ultrasound lower extremity ___ \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nLeft knee arthroplasty.

She is\r\ncurrently on C2D12 of treatment with decitabine and presents \r\nwith\r\none day of confusion and chills. Neutropenic and afebrile with \r\nno infectious source identified, improved rapidly to baseline on \r\n___ and IV antibiotics were deescalated. \r\n\r\n#Altered mental status: Presented with word finding difficulty \r\nand generalized malaise with decreased PO intake, without true \r\nglobal sensorium deficit. 1 month prior during hospitalization \r\nhad been diagnosed with presumed osteomyelitis though imaging \r\nwas equivocal, and started on 1 month broad spectrum ABX course. \r\nOn this admission, ___ c/f meningitis, cefepime was increased to \r\nmeningitis dosing and ampicillin was added. Her home vanc and \r\nmica were continued. On ___ ___ the patient rapidly improved and \r\nmental status and symptoms were back to her baseline. Urine \r\nculture drawn in the ED (taken in bed-pan, not sterile) grew \r\nEnteroccus faecium pan-resistant, including ampicillin and \r\nvancomycin. The organism was not sensitive to any of the \r\nantibiotics that she was on, thus the organism was not treated, \r\nhowever she improved to baseline as above. Thus the UTI was \r\nlikely not the source of her AMS. In this light, she was not \r\nsent out on further antibiotics, but was counseled to return to \r\nthe hospital if she developed urinary symptoms or more \r\nconfusion. The true etiology is unclear. It may have been a \r\nviral infection or possibly cerebral hypoperfusion in the \r\nsetting of vascular pathology (h/o aneurysms). \r\n\r\n#UTI: see above for urine culture growing Enterococcus faecium. \r\n\r\n#LLE edema: Had a history of DVTs and was previously on \r\nrivaroxaban but this had been held for some time ___ \r\nthrombocytopenia.

Evaluate for hemorrhage. \r\n  \r\nTECHNIQUE:  Sagittal and axial T1 weighted imaging were \r\nperformed. After \r\nadministration of 11 mL of Gadavist intravenous contrast, axial \r\nimaging was \r\nperformed with gradient echo, FLAIR, diffusion, and T1 \r\ntechnique. Sagittal \r\nMPRAGE imaging was performed and re-formatted in axial and \r\ncoronal \r\norientations. \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  CT head ___ \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nThere is no evidence of acute infarction, or intracranial \r\nhemorrhage.  The \r\nventricles are normal in size without mass effect or midline \r\nshift.  There is \r\nno abnormal enhancement, enhancing mass, or leptomeningeal \r\ndisease.  There is \r\nminimal nonspecific scattered foci of hyperintense T2/FLAIR \r\nsignal changes \r\nwithin the subcortical and periventricular white matter, which \r\nis likely a \r\nsequela of chronic small vessel microangiopathy.  The dural \r\nvenous sinuses \r\nappear patent on post-contrast MPRAGE images.  The paranasal \r\nsinuses appear \r\nclear.  The bilateral mastoid air cells appear unremarkable.  \r\nThe orbits and \r\nvisualized soft tissues appear unremarkable. \r\n  \r\nIMPRESSION: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n1. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, acute infarction, \r\nedema, or \r\nabnormal enhancement. \r\n\r\nEXAMINATION:  MR ___ AND W/O CONTRAST ___ MR SPINE \r\n  \r\nINDICATION:  ___ year old woman with transformed follicular \r\nlymphoma and h/o \r\nCLL s/p auto SCT in ___ in remission from lymphoma standpoint \r\nbut developed \r\ntreatment related MDS, receiving Dacogen who developed \r\nneutropenic fevers and \r\nMRI on ___ showed ? early discitis and L psoas abnormality \r\nnow 5 weeks \r\ninto antibiotics.  // Evaluate for the evolution of theL4-L5 \r\nprocess involving \r\nendplates and L psoas muscle  ___ year old woman with transformed \r\nfollicular \r\nlymphoma and h/o CLL s/p auto SCT in ___ in remission from \r\nlymphoma \r\nstandpoint but developed treatment related MDS, receiving \r\nDacogen who \r\ndeveloped neutropenic fevers and MRI on ___ showed ? early \r\ndiscitis and L \r\npsoas abnormality now 5 weeks into antibiotics.  // Evaluate for \r\nthe evolution \r\nof theL4-L5 process involving endplates and L psoas muscle   \r\nEvaluate for the \r\nevolution of theL4-L5 process involving endplates and L psoas \r\nmuscle \r\n  \r\nTECHNIQUE:  Sagittal imaging was performed with T2, T1, and STIR \r\ntechnique, \r\nfollowed by axial T2 imaging. This was followed by sagittal and \r\naxial T1 \r\nimages obtained after the uneventful intravenous administration \r\nof 11 mL of \r\nGadavist  contrast agent. \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  Lumbar spine MR examinations ___ and ___.  \r\nCT abdomen and pelvis ___. \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nAgain seen is scoliosis convex to the left in the upper lumbar \r\nspine and to \r\nthe right in the lower lumbar spine.  Again seen is anterior \r\nsubluxation of L5 \r\non S1.  Again seen is ___ type 1 signal intensity change at \r\nL2-3.  This \r\nincludes a low signal of the vertebral endplates on the T1 \r\nweighted images and \r\nhigh signal of these endplates on the STIR images.  This finding \r\nhas not \r\nchanged since ___. \r\n  \r\nNew since ___ but unchanged since ___ are \r\nsimilar changes \r\nat the L4-5 interspace.  There is low signal of the endplates on \r\nthe T1 \r\nweighted images and high signal on the STIR images.  All of the \r\nlumbar discs \r\nare hypointense on the T2 weighted and STIR images as are the \r\ndiscs at the T9 \r\nthrough T12 level.  These are further manifestations of \r\ndegenerative disc \r\ndisease.  The endplates at L2-3 and at L4-5 enhance after \r\ncontrast \r\nadministration.  This is typical ___ type 1 change.  The \r\nintervertebral \r\ndiscs themselves do not enhance after contrast administration. \r\n  \r\nAgain seen are hypointensities in the intervertebral discs at \r\nmultiple levels. \r\nCorrelation with the CT abdomen and pelvis of ___ \r\ndemonstrates \r\nthat at every level from L2 through S1 included a vacuum \r\nphenomenon in the \r\nintervertebral disc. \r\n  \r\nThere is no evidence of abnormal intraspinal \r\ncontrast-enhancement. \r\n  \r\nThe psoas and spinal erector muscles are asymmetric and \r\ndemonstrate fatty \r\natrophy bilaterally. These changes are likely a result of the \r\nscoliosis.  Much \r\nof the hyperintensity seen on the pre and postcontrast axial T1 \r\nweighted \r\nimages through the medial portion of the left psoas muscle at \r\nthe lower L4 \r\nlevel is due to the fatty atrophy, rather than enhancement.  It \r\nis unclear \r\nwhether there is any abnormal enhancement of the left psoas \r\nmuscle, if so, it \r\nis minimal. \r\n  \r\nHypointensity on the T1 weighted images with enhancement after \r\ncontrast \r\nadministration involves the left side of the superior portion of \r\nthe L5 \r\nvertebral body and extends through the pedicle into the facet \r\njoint.  This \r\ncorrelates with mild hyperintensity in these regions on the STIR \r\nimages.  \r\nThere is slight induration of the adjacent fat between the \r\nvertebral body and \r\nthe psoas muscle, best seen on image 30 of series 7 with \r\nenhancement seen on \r\nimage 30 of series 9.  These findings may represent further \r\ninflammatory \r\nchange due to degenerative disease, or a local focus of \r\ninfection.  Note that \r\nthis appearance is quite similar to that of the ___ \r\nstudy.  The CT \r\nscans through the left facet joint at this level consistently \r\ndemonstrated a \r\nvacuum phenomenon, arguing strongly against infection of the \r\njoint.  There is \r\nno evidence of bone destruction on the CT scans, which would be \r\nhighly unusual \r\nif there were chronic osteomyelitis extending as far back as \r\n___.  \r\nThere is similar mild enhancement posteriorly along the left \r\nlamina at this \r\nlevel.  Overall, these findings again are more likely due to \r\ninflammatory \r\ndegenerative disease than infection. \r\n  \r\nThe combination of vacuum phenomenon, low signal of the disc on \r\nthe T2 \r\nweighted images, ___ type 1 signal intensity changes of the \r\nendplates and \r\nstability over time all argue in favor of degenerative disc \r\ndisease as the \r\ncause of these changes.  This constellation of findings would be \r\nextremely \r\nunlikely in the setting of discitis. \r\n  \r\nThere is a mild bulge of the T11-12 disc with no encroachment on \r\nthe spinal \r\ncord or neural foramina. \r\n  \r\nAt T12-L1 there is no encroachment on the cord or foramina.  \r\nIncidentally \r\nnoted is an apparent right renal cyst, better evaluated on the \r\nrecent CT scan. \r\nThere is a small midline and right-sided protrusion of the \r\nintervertebral disc \r\nthat extends superiorly along the posterior margin of the L1 \r\nvertebral body.  \r\nThis does not contact the nerve roots.  The neural foramina \r\nappear normal. \r\n  \r\nAt L1-2 there is a small midline and right-sided disc protrusion \r\nthat \r\nencroaches on the thecal sac but does not contact the nerve \r\nroots.  This \r\nfragment extends superiorly along the posterior margin of the L1 \r\nbody.  The \r\nneural foramina appear normal. \r\n  \r\nAt L2-3, bulging of the disc and facet osteophytes produce \r\nencroachment on the \r\ntraversing L3 nerve roots bilaterally.  There is narrowing of \r\nthe right neural \r\nforamen due to facet osteophytes and intervertebral osteophytes. \r\n\r\n  \r\nAt L3-4, disc bulging and intervertebral osteophytes contact the \r\ntraversing \r\nright L4 nerve root.  The neural foramina are moderately \r\nnarrowed bilaterally. \r\n  \r\nAt L4-5, there is disc bulging but no evidence of nerve root \r\ncompression \r\nwithin the spinal canal.  There are prominent facet osteophytes \r\nbilaterally \r\nthe produce severe left and moderate right \r\n  \r\nAt L5-S1, there is elongation of the spinal canal due to the \r\nsubluxation of L5 \r\non S1.  There are prominent facet osteophytes bilaterally.  The \r\ncombination of \r\nthese factors and loss of height of the intervertebral disc as \r\nwell as disc \r\nbulging produces moderate -severe narrowing of the neural \r\nforamina \r\nbilaterally. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIMPRESSION: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n1. As discussed above, the vertebral, intervertebral disc, facet \r\nand left \r\npsoas muscle findings are likely due to a combination of \r\nscoliosis and chronic \r\ndegenerative disc disease, likely with inflammation on this \r\nbasis. \r\n2. The minimal change over time, vacuum phenomenon in the \r\nintervertebral discs \r\nand facet joints, absence of bone destruction and pattern of \r\nsignal intensity \r\nabnormalities argue against infection as the etiology. \r\n3. Degenerative disc disease produces mild encroachment on \r\nseveral nerve roots \r\nand more severe narrowing of the neural foramina at several \r\nlevels. \r\n\r\nEXAMINATION:  TIB/FIB (AP AND LAT) LEFT \r\n  \r\nINDICATION:  ___ year old woman with LLE edema, phlebolith seen \r\non US  // \r\nphlebolith seen on US? \r\n  \r\nTECHNIQUE:  Left tibia, fibula two views \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  Ultrasound lower extremity ___ \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nLeft knee arthroplasty.

Neutropenic and afebrile with \r\nno infectious source identified, improved rapidly to baseline on \r\n___ and IV antibiotics were deescalated. \r\n\r\n#Altered mental status: Presented with word finding difficulty \r\nand generalized malaise with decreased PO intake, without true \r\nglobal sensorium deficit. 1 month prior during hospitalization \r\nhad been diagnosed with presumed osteomyelitis though imaging \r\nwas equivocal, and started on 1 month broad spectrum ABX course. \r\nOn this admission, ___ c/f meningitis, cefepime was increased to \r\nmeningitis dosing and ampicillin was added. Her home vanc and \r\nmica were continued. On ___ ___ the patient rapidly improved and \r\nmental status and symptoms were back to her baseline. Urine \r\nculture drawn in the ED (taken in bed-pan, not sterile) grew \r\nEnteroccus faecium pan-resistant, including ampicillin and \r\nvancomycin. The organism was not sensitive to any of the \r\nantibiotics that she was on, thus the organism was not treated, \r\nhowever she improved to baseline as above. Thus the UTI was \r\nlikely not the source of her AMS. In this light, she was not \r\nsent out on further antibiotics, but was counseled to return to \r\nthe hospital if she developed urinary symptoms or more \r\nconfusion. The true etiology is unclear. It may have been a \r\nviral infection or possibly cerebral hypoperfusion in the \r\nsetting of vascular pathology (h/o aneurysms). \r\n\r\n#UTI: see above for urine culture growing Enterococcus faecium. \r\n\r\n#LLE edema: Had a history of DVTs and was previously on \r\nrivaroxaban but this had been held for some time ___ \r\nthrombocytopenia.

After \r\nadministration of 11 mL of Gadavist intravenous contrast, axial \r\nimaging was \r\nperformed with gradient echo, FLAIR, diffusion, and T1 \r\ntechnique. Sagittal \r\nMPRAGE imaging was performed and re-formatted in axial and \r\ncoronal \r\norientations. \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  CT head ___ \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nThere is no evidence of acute infarction, or intracranial \r\nhemorrhage.  The \r\nventricles are normal in size without mass effect or midline \r\nshift.  There is \r\nno abnormal enhancement, enhancing mass, or leptomeningeal \r\ndisease.  There is \r\nminimal nonspecific scattered foci of hyperintense T2/FLAIR \r\nsignal changes \r\nwithin the subcortical and periventricular white matter, which \r\nis likely a \r\nsequela of chronic small vessel microangiopathy.

This was followed by sagittal and \r\naxial T1 \r\nimages obtained after the uneventful intravenous administration \r\nof 11 mL of \r\nGadavist  contrast agent. \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  Lumbar spine MR examinations ___ and ___.  \r\nCT abdomen and pelvis ___. \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nAgain seen is scoliosis convex to the left in the upper lumbar \r\nspine and to \r\nthe right in the lower lumbar spine.  Again seen is anterior \r\nsubluxation of L5 \r\non S1.  Again seen is ___ type 1 signal intensity change at \r\nL2-3.  This \r\nincludes a low signal of the vertebral endplates on the T1 \r\nweighted images and \r\nhigh signal of these endplates on the STIR images.  This finding \r\nhas not \r\nchanged since ___. \r\n  \r\nNew since ___ but unchanged since ___ are \r\nsimilar changes \r\nat the L4-5 interspace.  There is low signal of the endplates on \r\nthe T1 \r\nweighted images and high signal on the STIR images.  All of the \r\nlumbar discs \r\nare hypointense on the T2 weighted and STIR images as are the \r\ndiscs at the T9 \r\nthrough T12 level.  These are further manifestations of \r\ndegenerative disc \r\ndisease.  The endplates at L2-3 and at L4-5 enhance after \r\ncontrast \r\nadministration.  This is typical ___ type 1 change.  The \r\nintervertebral \r\ndiscs themselves do not enhance after contrast administration. \r\n  \r\nAgain seen are hypointensities in the intervertebral discs at \r\nmultiple levels. \r\nCorrelation with the CT abdomen and pelvis of ___ \r\ndemonstrates \r\nthat at every level from L2 through S1 included a vacuum \r\nphenomenon in the \r\nintervertebral disc. \r\n  \r\nThere is no evidence of abnormal intraspinal \r\ncontrast-enhancement. \r\n  \r\nThe psoas and spinal erector muscles are asymmetric and \r\ndemonstrate fatty \r\natrophy bilaterally. These changes are likely a result of the \r\nscoliosis.  Much \r\nof the hyperintensity seen on the pre and postcontrast axial T1 \r\nweighted \r\nimages through the medial portion of the left psoas muscle at \r\nthe lower L4 \r\nlevel is due to the fatty atrophy, rather than enhancement.  It \r\nis unclear \r\nwhether there is any abnormal enhancement of the left psoas \r\nmuscle, if so, it \r\nis minimal. \r\n  \r\nHypointensity on the T1 weighted images with enhancement after \r\ncontrast \r\nadministration involves the left side of the superior portion of \r\nthe L5 \r\nvertebral body and extends through the pedicle into the facet \r\njoint.  This \r\ncorrelates with mild hyperintensity in these regions on the STIR \r\nimages.  \r\nThere is slight induration of the adjacent fat between the \r\nvertebral body and \r\nthe psoas muscle, best seen on image 30 of series 7 with \r\nenhancement seen on \r\nimage 30 of series 9.  These findings may represent further \r\ninflammatory \r\nchange due to degenerative disease, or a local focus of \r\ninfection.  Note that \r\nthis appearance is quite similar to that of the ___ \r\nstudy.  The CT \r\nscans through the left facet joint at this level consistently \r\ndemonstrated a \r\nvacuum phenomenon, arguing strongly against infection of the \r\njoint.  There is \r\nno evidence of bone destruction on the CT scans, which would be \r\nhighly unusual \r\nif there were chronic osteomyelitis extending as far back as \r\n___.  \r\nThere is similar mild enhancement posteriorly along the left \r\nlamina at this \r\nlevel.  Overall, these findings again are more likely due to \r\ninflammatory \r\ndegenerative disease than infection. \r\n  \r\nThe combination of vacuum phenomenon, low signal of the disc on \r\nthe T2 \r\nweighted images, ___ type 1 signal intensity changes of the \r\nendplates and \r\nstability over time all argue in favor of degenerative disc \r\ndisease as the \r\ncause of these changes.  This constellation of findings would be \r\nextremely \r\nunlikely in the setting of discitis. \r\n  \r\nThere is a mild bulge of the T11-12 disc with no encroachment on \r\nthe spinal \r\ncord or neural foramina. \r\n  \r\nAt T12-L1 there is no encroachment on the cord or foramina.  \r\nIncidentally \r\nnoted is an apparent right renal cyst, better evaluated on the \r\nrecent CT scan. \r\nThere is a small midline and right-sided protrusion of the \r\nintervertebral disc \r\nthat extends superiorly along the posterior margin of the L1 \r\nvertebral body.  \r\nThis does not contact the nerve roots.  The neural foramina \r\nappear normal. \r\n  \r\nAt L1-2 there is a small midline and right-sided disc protrusion \r\nthat \r\nencroaches on the thecal sac but does not contact the nerve \r\nroots.  This \r\nfragment extends superiorly along the posterior margin of the L1 \r\nbody.  The \r\nneural foramina appear normal. \r\n  \r\nAt L2-3, bulging of the disc and facet osteophytes produce \r\nencroachment on the \r\ntraversing L3 nerve roots bilaterally.  There is narrowing of \r\nthe right neural \r\nforamen due to facet osteophytes and intervertebral osteophytes. \r\n\r\n  \r\nAt L3-4, disc bulging and intervertebral osteophytes contact the \r\ntraversing \r\nright L4 nerve root.  The neural foramina are moderately \r\nnarrowed bilaterally. \r\n  \r\nAt L4-5, there is disc bulging but no evidence of nerve root \r\ncompression \r\nwithin the spinal canal.  There are prominent facet osteophytes \r\nbilaterally \r\nthe produce severe left and moderate right \r\n  \r\nAt L5-S1, there is elongation of the spinal canal due to the \r\nsubluxation of L5 \r\non S1.  There are prominent facet osteophytes bilaterally.  The \r\ncombination of \r\nthese factors and loss of height of the intervertebral disc as \r\nwell as disc \r\nbulging produces moderate -severe narrowing of the neural \r\nforamina \r\nbilaterally. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIMPRESSION: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n1. As discussed above, the vertebral, intervertebral disc, facet \r\nand left \r\npsoas muscle findings are likely due to a combination of \r\nscoliosis and chronic \r\ndegenerative disc disease, likely with inflammation on this \r\nbasis. \r\n2. The minimal change over time, vacuum phenomenon in the \r\nintervertebral discs \r\nand facet joints, absence of bone destruction and pattern of \r\nsignal intensity \r\nabnormalities argue against infection as the etiology. \r\n3. Degenerative disc disease produces mild encroachment on \r\nseveral nerve roots \r\nand more severe narrowing of the neural foramina at several \r\nlevels. \r\n\r\nEXAMINATION:  TIB/FIB (AP AND LAT) LEFT \r\n  \r\nINDICATION:  ___ year old woman with LLE edema, phlebolith seen \r\non US  // \r\nphlebolith seen on US? \r\n  \r\nTECHNIQUE:  Left tibia, fibula two views \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  Ultrasound lower extremity ___ \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nLeft knee arthroplasty.

Neutropenic and afebrile with \r\nno infectious source identified, improved rapidly to baseline on \r\n___ and IV antibiotics were deescalated. \r\n\r\n#Altered mental status: Presented with word finding difficulty \r\nand generalized malaise with decreased PO intake, without true \r\nglobal sensorium deficit. 1 month prior during hospitalization \r\nhad been diagnosed with presumed osteomyelitis though imaging \r\nwas equivocal, and started on 1 month broad spectrum ABX course. \r\nOn this admission, ___ c/f meningitis, cefepime was increased to \r\nmeningitis dosing and ampicillin was added. Her home vanc and \r\nmica were continued. On ___ ___ the patient rapidly improved and \r\nmental status and symptoms were back to her baseline. Urine \r\nculture drawn in the ED (taken in bed-pan, not sterile) grew \r\nEnteroccus faecium pan-resistant, including ampicillin and \r\nvancomycin. The organism was not sensitive to any of the \r\nantibiotics that she was on, thus the organism was not treated, \r\nhowever she improved to baseline as above. Thus the UTI was \r\nlikely not the source of her AMS. In this light, she was not \r\nsent out on further antibiotics, but was counseled to return to \r\nthe hospital if she developed urinary symptoms or more \r\nconfusion. The true etiology is unclear. It may have been a \r\nviral infection or possibly cerebral hypoperfusion in the \r\nsetting of vascular pathology (h/o aneurysms). \r\n\r\n#UTI: see above for urine culture growing Enterococcus faecium. \r\n\r\n#LLE edema: Had a history of DVTs and was previously on \r\nrivaroxaban but this had been held for some time ___ \r\nthrombocytopenia.

Evaluate for hemorrhage. \r\n  \r\nTECHNIQUE:  Sagittal and axial T1 weighted imaging were \r\nperformed. After \r\nadministration of 11 mL of Gadavist intravenous contrast, axial \r\nimaging was \r\nperformed with gradient echo, FLAIR, diffusion, and T1 \r\ntechnique. Sagittal \r\nMPRAGE imaging was performed and re-formatted in axial and \r\ncoronal \r\norientations. \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  CT head ___ \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nThere is no evidence of acute infarction, or intracranial \r\nhemorrhage.  The \r\nventricles are normal in size without mass effect or midline \r\nshift.  There is \r\nno abnormal enhancement, enhancing mass, or leptomeningeal \r\ndisease.  There is \r\nminimal nonspecific scattered foci of hyperintense T2/FLAIR \r\nsignal changes \r\nwithin the subcortical and periventricular white matter, which \r\nis likely a \r\nsequela of chronic small vessel microangiopathy.  The dural \r\nvenous sinuses \r\nappear patent on post-contrast MPRAGE images.  The paranasal \r\nsinuses appear \r\nclear.

This was followed by sagittal and \r\naxial T1 \r\nimages obtained after the uneventful intravenous administration \r\nof 11 mL of \r\nGadavist  contrast agent. \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  Lumbar spine MR examinations ___ and ___.  \r\nCT abdomen and pelvis ___. \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nAgain seen is scoliosis convex to the left in the upper lumbar \r\nspine and to \r\nthe right in the lower lumbar spine.  Again seen is anterior \r\nsubluxation of L5 \r\non S1.  Again seen is ___ type 1 signal intensity change at \r\nL2-3.  This \r\nincludes a low signal of the vertebral endplates on the T1 \r\nweighted images and \r\nhigh signal of these endplates on the STIR images.  This finding \r\nhas not \r\nchanged since ___. \r\n  \r\nNew since ___ but unchanged since ___ are \r\nsimilar changes \r\nat the L4-5 interspace.  There is low signal of the endplates on \r\nthe T1 \r\nweighted images and high signal on the STIR images.  All of the \r\nlumbar discs \r\nare hypointense on the T2 weighted and STIR images as are the \r\ndiscs at the T9 \r\nthrough T12 level.  These are further manifestations of \r\ndegenerative disc \r\ndisease.  The endplates at L2-3 and at L4-5 enhance after \r\ncontrast \r\nadministration.  This is typical ___ type 1 change.  The \r\nintervertebral \r\ndiscs themselves do not enhance after contrast administration. \r\n  \r\nAgain seen are hypointensities in the intervertebral discs at \r\nmultiple levels. \r\nCorrelation with the CT abdomen and pelvis of ___ \r\ndemonstrates \r\nthat at every level from L2 through S1 included a vacuum \r\nphenomenon in the \r\nintervertebral disc. \r\n  \r\nThere is no evidence of abnormal intraspinal \r\ncontrast-enhancement. \r\n  \r\nThe psoas and spinal erector muscles are asymmetric and \r\ndemonstrate fatty \r\natrophy bilaterally. These changes are likely a result of the \r\nscoliosis.  Much \r\nof the hyperintensity seen on the pre and postcontrast axial T1 \r\nweighted \r\nimages through the medial portion of the left psoas muscle at \r\nthe lower L4 \r\nlevel is due to the fatty atrophy, rather than enhancement.  It \r\nis unclear \r\nwhether there is any abnormal enhancement of the left psoas \r\nmuscle, if so, it \r\nis minimal. \r\n  \r\nHypointensity on the T1 weighted images with enhancement after \r\ncontrast \r\nadministration involves the left side of the superior portion of \r\nthe L5 \r\nvertebral body and extends through the pedicle into the facet \r\njoint.  This \r\ncorrelates with mild hyperintensity in these regions on the STIR \r\nimages.  \r\nThere is slight induration of the adjacent fat between the \r\nvertebral body and \r\nthe psoas muscle, best seen on image 30 of series 7 with \r\nenhancement seen on \r\nimage 30 of series 9.  These findings may represent further \r\ninflammatory \r\nchange due to degenerative disease, or a local focus of \r\ninfection.  Note that \r\nthis appearance is quite similar to that of the ___ \r\nstudy.  The CT \r\nscans through the left facet joint at this level consistently \r\ndemonstrated a \r\nvacuum phenomenon, arguing strongly against infection of the \r\njoint.  There is \r\nno evidence of bone destruction on the CT scans, which would be \r\nhighly unusual \r\nif there were chronic osteomyelitis extending as far back as \r\n___.  \r\nThere is similar mild enhancement posteriorly along the left \r\nlamina at this \r\nlevel.  Overall, these findings again are more likely due to \r\ninflammatory \r\ndegenerative disease than infection. \r\n  \r\nThe combination of vacuum phenomenon, low signal of the disc on \r\nthe T2 \r\nweighted images, ___ type 1 signal intensity changes of the \r\nendplates and \r\nstability over time all argue in favor of degenerative disc \r\ndisease as the \r\ncause of these changes.  This constellation of findings would be \r\nextremely \r\nunlikely in the setting of discitis. \r\n  \r\nThere is a mild bulge of the T11-12 disc with no encroachment on \r\nthe spinal \r\ncord or neural foramina. \r\n  \r\nAt T12-L1 there is no encroachment on the cord or foramina.  \r\nIncidentally \r\nnoted is an apparent right renal cyst, better evaluated on the \r\nrecent CT scan. \r\nThere is a small midline and right-sided protrusion of the \r\nintervertebral disc \r\nthat extends superiorly along the posterior margin of the L1 \r\nvertebral body.  \r\nThis does not contact the nerve roots.  The neural foramina \r\nappear normal. \r\n  \r\nAt L1-2 there is a small midline and right-sided disc protrusion \r\nthat \r\nencroaches on the thecal sac but does not contact the nerve \r\nroots.  This \r\nfragment extends superiorly along the posterior margin of the L1 \r\nbody.  The \r\nneural foramina appear normal. \r\n  \r\nAt L2-3, bulging of the disc and facet osteophytes produce \r\nencroachment on the \r\ntraversing L3 nerve roots bilaterally.  There is narrowing of \r\nthe right neural \r\nforamen due to facet osteophytes and intervertebral osteophytes. \r\n\r\n  \r\nAt L3-4, disc bulging and intervertebral osteophytes contact the \r\ntraversing \r\nright L4 nerve root.  The neural foramina are moderately \r\nnarrowed bilaterally. \r\n  \r\nAt L4-5, there is disc bulging but no evidence of nerve root \r\ncompression \r\nwithin the spinal canal.  There are prominent facet osteophytes \r\nbilaterally \r\nthe produce severe left and moderate right \r\n  \r\nAt L5-S1, there is elongation of the spinal canal due to the \r\nsubluxation of L5 \r\non S1.  There are prominent facet osteophytes bilaterally.  The \r\ncombination of \r\nthese factors and loss of height of the intervertebral disc as \r\nwell as disc \r\nbulging produces moderate -severe narrowing of the neural \r\nforamina \r\nbilaterally. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIMPRESSION: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n1. As discussed above, the vertebral, intervertebral disc, facet \r\nand left \r\npsoas muscle findings are likely due to a combination of \r\nscoliosis and chronic \r\ndegenerative disc disease, likely with inflammation on this \r\nbasis. \r\n2. The minimal change over time, vacuum phenomenon in the \r\nintervertebral discs \r\nand facet joints, absence of bone destruction and pattern of \r\nsignal intensity \r\nabnormalities argue against infection as the etiology. \r\n3. Degenerative disc disease produces mild encroachment on \r\nseveral nerve roots \r\nand more severe narrowing of the neural foramina at several \r\nlevels. \r\n\r\nEXAMINATION:  TIB/FIB (AP AND LAT) LEFT \r\n  \r\nINDICATION:  ___ year old woman with LLE edema, phlebolith seen \r\non US  // \r\nphlebolith seen on US? \r\n  \r\nTECHNIQUE:  Left tibia, fibula two views \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  Ultrasound lower extremity ___ \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nLeft knee arthroplasty.

She is\r\ncurrently on C2D12 of treatment with decitabine and presents \r\nwith\r\none day of confusion and chills. Neutropenic and afebrile with \r\nno infectious source identified, improved rapidly to baseline on \r\n___ and IV antibiotics were deescalated. \r\n\r\n#Altered mental status: Presented with word finding difficulty \r\nand generalized malaise with decreased PO intake, without true \r\nglobal sensorium deficit. 1 month prior during hospitalization \r\nhad been diagnosed with presumed osteomyelitis though imaging \r\nwas equivocal, and started on 1 month broad spectrum ABX course. \r\nOn this admission, ___ c/f meningitis, cefepime was increased to \r\nmeningitis dosing and ampicillin was added. Her home vanc and \r\nmica were continued. On ___ ___ the patient rapidly improved and \r\nmental status and symptoms were back to her baseline. Urine \r\nculture drawn in the ED (taken in bed-pan, not sterile) grew \r\nEnteroccus faecium pan-resistant, including ampicillin and \r\nvancomycin. The organism was not sensitive to any of the \r\nantibiotics that she was on, thus the organism was not treated, \r\nhowever she improved to baseline as above. Thus the UTI was \r\nlikely not the source of her AMS. In this light, she was not \r\nsent out on further antibiotics, but was counseled to return to \r\nthe hospital if she developed urinary symptoms or more \r\nconfusion. The true etiology is unclear. It may have been a \r\nviral infection or possibly cerebral hypoperfusion in the \r\nsetting of vascular pathology (h/o aneurysms). \r\n\r\n#UTI: see above for urine culture growing Enterococcus faecium. \r\n\r\n#LLE edema: Had a history of DVTs and was previously on \r\nrivaroxaban but this had been held for some time ___ \r\nthrombocytopenia.

This was followed by sagittal and \r\naxial T1 \r\nimages obtained after the uneventful intravenous administration \r\nof 11 mL of \r\nGadavist  contrast agent. \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  Lumbar spine MR examinations ___ and ___.  \r\nCT abdomen and pelvis ___. \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nAgain seen is scoliosis convex to the left in the upper lumbar \r\nspine and to \r\nthe right in the lower lumbar spine.  Again seen is anterior \r\nsubluxation of L5 \r\non S1.  Again seen is ___ type 1 signal intensity change at \r\nL2-3.  This \r\nincludes a low signal of the vertebral endplates on the T1 \r\nweighted images and \r\nhigh signal of these endplates on the STIR images.  This finding \r\nhas not \r\nchanged since ___. \r\n  \r\nNew since ___ but unchanged since ___ are \r\nsimilar changes \r\nat the L4-5 interspace.  There is low signal of the endplates on \r\nthe T1 \r\nweighted images and high signal on the STIR images.  All of the \r\nlumbar discs \r\nare hypointense on the T2 weighted and STIR images as are the \r\ndiscs at the T9 \r\nthrough T12 level.  These are further manifestations of \r\ndegenerative disc \r\ndisease.  The endplates at L2-3 and at L4-5 enhance after \r\ncontrast \r\nadministration.  This is typical ___ type 1 change.  The \r\nintervertebral \r\ndiscs themselves do not enhance after contrast administration. \r\n  \r\nAgain seen are hypointensities in the intervertebral discs at \r\nmultiple levels. \r\nCorrelation with the CT abdomen and pelvis of ___ \r\ndemonstrates \r\nthat at every level from L2 through S1 included a vacuum \r\nphenomenon in the \r\nintervertebral disc. \r\n  \r\nThere is no evidence of abnormal intraspinal \r\ncontrast-enhancement. \r\n  \r\nThe psoas and spinal erector muscles are asymmetric and \r\ndemonstrate fatty \r\natrophy bilaterally. These changes are likely a result of the \r\nscoliosis.  Much \r\nof the hyperintensity seen on the pre and postcontrast axial T1 \r\nweighted \r\nimages through the medial portion of the left psoas muscle at \r\nthe lower L4 \r\nlevel is due to the fatty atrophy, rather than enhancement.  It \r\nis unclear \r\nwhether there is any abnormal enhancement of the left psoas \r\nmuscle, if so, it \r\nis minimal. \r\n  \r\nHypointensity on the T1 weighted images with enhancement after \r\ncontrast \r\nadministration involves the left side of the superior portion of \r\nthe L5 \r\nvertebral body and extends through the pedicle into the facet \r\njoint.  This \r\ncorrelates with mild hyperintensity in these regions on the STIR \r\nimages.  \r\nThere is slight induration of the adjacent fat between the \r\nvertebral body and \r\nthe psoas muscle, best seen on image 30 of series 7 with \r\nenhancement seen on \r\nimage 30 of series 9.  These findings may represent further \r\ninflammatory \r\nchange due to degenerative disease, or a local focus of \r\ninfection.  Note that \r\nthis appearance is quite similar to that of the ___ \r\nstudy.  The CT \r\nscans through the left facet joint at this level consistently \r\ndemonstrated a \r\nvacuum phenomenon, arguing strongly against infection of the \r\njoint.  There is \r\nno evidence of bone destruction on the CT scans, which would be \r\nhighly unusual \r\nif there were chronic osteomyelitis extending as far back as \r\n___.  \r\nThere is similar mild enhancement posteriorly along the left \r\nlamina at this \r\nlevel.  Overall, these findings again are more likely due to \r\ninflammatory \r\ndegenerative disease than infection. \r\n  \r\nThe combination of vacuum phenomenon, low signal of the disc on \r\nthe T2 \r\nweighted images, ___ type 1 signal intensity changes of the \r\nendplates and \r\nstability over time all argue in favor of degenerative disc \r\ndisease as the \r\ncause of these changes.  This constellation of findings would be \r\nextremely \r\nunlikely in the setting of discitis. \r\n  \r\nThere is a mild bulge of the T11-12 disc with no encroachment on \r\nthe spinal \r\ncord or neural foramina. \r\n  \r\nAt T12-L1 there is no encroachment on the cord or foramina.  \r\nIncidentally \r\nnoted is an apparent right renal cyst, better evaluated on the \r\nrecent CT scan. \r\nThere is a small midline and right-sided protrusion of the \r\nintervertebral disc \r\nthat extends superiorly along the posterior margin of the L1 \r\nvertebral body.  \r\nThis does not contact the nerve roots.  The neural foramina \r\nappear normal. \r\n  \r\nAt L1-2 there is a small midline and right-sided disc protrusion \r\nthat \r\nencroaches on the thecal sac but does not contact the nerve \r\nroots.  This \r\nfragment extends superiorly along the posterior margin of the L1 \r\nbody.  The \r\nneural foramina appear normal. \r\n  \r\nAt L2-3, bulging of the disc and facet osteophytes produce \r\nencroachment on the \r\ntraversing L3 nerve roots bilaterally.  There is narrowing of \r\nthe right neural \r\nforamen due to facet osteophytes and intervertebral osteophytes. \r\n\r\n  \r\nAt L3-4, disc bulging and intervertebral osteophytes contact the \r\ntraversing \r\nright L4 nerve root.  The neural foramina are moderately \r\nnarrowed bilaterally. \r\n  \r\nAt L4-5, there is disc bulging but no evidence of nerve root \r\ncompression \r\nwithin the spinal canal.  There are prominent facet osteophytes \r\nbilaterally \r\nthe produce severe left and moderate right \r\n  \r\nAt L5-S1, there is elongation of the spinal canal due to the \r\nsubluxation of L5 \r\non S1.  There are prominent facet osteophytes bilaterally.  The \r\ncombination of \r\nthese factors and loss of height of the intervertebral disc as \r\nwell as disc \r\nbulging produces moderate -severe narrowing of the neural \r\nforamina \r\nbilaterally. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIMPRESSION: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n1. As discussed above, the vertebral, intervertebral disc, facet \r\nand left \r\npsoas muscle findings are likely due to a combination of \r\nscoliosis and chronic \r\ndegenerative disc disease, likely with inflammation on this \r\nbasis. \r\n2. The minimal change over time, vacuum phenomenon in the \r\nintervertebral discs \r\nand facet joints, absence of bone destruction and pattern of \r\nsignal intensity \r\nabnormalities argue against infection as the etiology. \r\n3. Degenerative disc disease produces mild encroachment on \r\nseveral nerve roots \r\nand more severe narrowing of the neural foramina at several \r\nlevels. \r\n\r\nEXAMINATION:  TIB/FIB (AP AND LAT) LEFT \r\n  \r\nINDICATION:  ___ year old woman with LLE edema, phlebolith seen \r\non US  // \r\nphlebolith seen on US? \r\n  \r\nTECHNIQUE:  Left tibia, fibula two views \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  Ultrasound lower extremity ___ \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nLeft knee arthroplasty.

Neutropenic and afebrile with \r\nno infectious source identified, improved rapidly to baseline on \r\n___ and IV antibiotics were deescalated. \r\n\r\n#Altered mental status: Presented with word finding difficulty \r\nand generalized malaise with decreased PO intake, without true \r\nglobal sensorium deficit. 1 month prior during hospitalization \r\nhad been diagnosed with presumed osteomyelitis though imaging \r\nwas equivocal, and started on 1 month broad spectrum ABX course. \r\nOn this admission, ___ c/f meningitis, cefepime was increased to \r\nmeningitis dosing and ampicillin was added. Her home vanc and \r\nmica were continued. On ___ ___ the patient rapidly improved and \r\nmental status and symptoms were back to her baseline. Urine \r\nculture drawn in the ED (taken in bed-pan, not sterile) grew \r\nEnteroccus faecium pan-resistant, including ampicillin and \r\nvancomycin. The organism was not sensitive to any of the \r\nantibiotics that she was on, thus the organism was not treated, \r\nhowever she improved to baseline as above. Thus the UTI was \r\nlikely not the source of her AMS. In this light, she was not \r\nsent out on further antibiotics, but was counseled to return to \r\nthe hospital if she developed urinary symptoms or more \r\nconfusion. The true etiology is unclear. It may have been a \r\nviral infection or possibly cerebral hypoperfusion in the \r\nsetting of vascular pathology (h/o aneurysms). \r\n\r\n#UTI: see above for urine culture growing Enterococcus faecium. \r\n\r\n#LLE edema: Had a history of DVTs and was previously on \r\nrivaroxaban but this had been held for some time ___ \r\nthrombocytopenia.

Evaluate for hemorrhage. \r\n  \r\nTECHNIQUE:  Sagittal and axial T1 weighted imaging were \r\nperformed. After \r\nadministration of 11 mL of Gadavist intravenous contrast, axial \r\nimaging was \r\nperformed with gradient echo, FLAIR, diffusion, and T1 \r\ntechnique. Sagittal \r\nMPRAGE imaging was performed and re-formatted in axial and \r\ncoronal \r\norientations. \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  CT head ___ \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nThere is no evidence of acute infarction, or intracranial \r\nhemorrhage.  The \r\nventricles are normal in size without mass effect or midline \r\nshift.  There is \r\nno abnormal enhancement, enhancing mass, or leptomeningeal \r\ndisease.  There is \r\nminimal nonspecific scattered foci of hyperintense T2/FLAIR \r\nsignal changes \r\nwithin the subcortical and periventricular white matter, which \r\nis likely a \r\nsequela of chronic small vessel microangiopathy.  The dural \r\nvenous sinuses \r\nappear patent on post-contrast MPRAGE images.  The paranasal \r\nsinuses appear \r\nclear.

This was followed by sagittal and \r\naxial T1 \r\nimages obtained after the uneventful intravenous administration \r\nof 11 mL of \r\nGadavist  contrast agent. \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  Lumbar spine MR examinations ___ and ___.  \r\nCT abdomen and pelvis ___. \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nAgain seen is scoliosis convex to the left in the upper lumbar \r\nspine and to \r\nthe right in the lower lumbar spine.  Again seen is anterior \r\nsubluxation of L5 \r\non S1.  Again seen is ___ type 1 signal intensity change at \r\nL2-3.  This \r\nincludes a low signal of the vertebral endplates on the T1 \r\nweighted images and \r\nhigh signal of these endplates on the STIR images.  This finding \r\nhas not \r\nchanged since ___. \r\n  \r\nNew since ___ but unchanged since ___ are \r\nsimilar changes \r\nat the L4-5 interspace.  There is low signal of the endplates on \r\nthe T1 \r\nweighted images and high signal on the STIR images.  All of the \r\nlumbar discs \r\nare hypointense on the T2 weighted and STIR images as are the \r\ndiscs at the T9 \r\nthrough T12 level.  These are further manifestations of \r\ndegenerative disc \r\ndisease.  The endplates at L2-3 and at L4-5 enhance after \r\ncontrast \r\nadministration.  This is typical ___ type 1 change.  The \r\nintervertebral \r\ndiscs themselves do not enhance after contrast administration. \r\n  \r\nAgain seen are hypointensities in the intervertebral discs at \r\nmultiple levels. \r\nCorrelation with the CT abdomen and pelvis of ___ \r\ndemonstrates \r\nthat at every level from L2 through S1 included a vacuum \r\nphenomenon in the \r\nintervertebral disc. \r\n  \r\nThere is no evidence of abnormal intraspinal \r\ncontrast-enhancement. \r\n  \r\nThe psoas and spinal erector muscles are asymmetric and \r\ndemonstrate fatty \r\natrophy bilaterally. These changes are likely a result of the \r\nscoliosis.  Much \r\nof the hyperintensity seen on the pre and postcontrast axial T1 \r\nweighted \r\nimages through the medial portion of the left psoas muscle at \r\nthe lower L4 \r\nlevel is due to the fatty atrophy, rather than enhancement.  It \r\nis unclear \r\nwhether there is any abnormal enhancement of the left psoas \r\nmuscle, if so, it \r\nis minimal. \r\n  \r\nHypointensity on the T1 weighted images with enhancement after \r\ncontrast \r\nadministration involves the left side of the superior portion of \r\nthe L5 \r\nvertebral body and extends through the pedicle into the facet \r\njoint.  This \r\ncorrelates with mild hyperintensity in these regions on the STIR \r\nimages.  \r\nThere is slight induration of the adjacent fat between the \r\nvertebral body and \r\nthe psoas muscle, best seen on image 30 of series 7 with \r\nenhancement seen on \r\nimage 30 of series 9.  These findings may represent further \r\ninflammatory \r\nchange due to degenerative disease, or a local focus of \r\ninfection.  Note that \r\nthis appearance is quite similar to that of the ___ \r\nstudy.  The CT \r\nscans through the left facet joint at this level consistently \r\ndemonstrated a \r\nvacuum phenomenon, arguing strongly against infection of the \r\njoint.  There is \r\nno evidence of bone destruction on the CT scans, which would be \r\nhighly unusual \r\nif there were chronic osteomyelitis extending as far back as \r\n___.  \r\nThere is similar mild enhancement posteriorly along the left \r\nlamina at this \r\nlevel.  Overall, these findings again are more likely due to \r\ninflammatory \r\ndegenerative disease than infection. \r\n  \r\nThe combination of vacuum phenomenon, low signal of the disc on \r\nthe T2 \r\nweighted images, ___ type 1 signal intensity changes of the \r\nendplates and \r\nstability over time all argue in favor of degenerative disc \r\ndisease as the \r\ncause of these changes.  This constellation of findings would be \r\nextremely \r\nunlikely in the setting of discitis. \r\n  \r\nThere is a mild bulge of the T11-12 disc with no encroachment on \r\nthe spinal \r\ncord or neural foramina. \r\n  \r\nAt T12-L1 there is no encroachment on the cord or foramina.  \r\nIncidentally \r\nnoted is an apparent right renal cyst, better evaluated on the \r\nrecent CT scan. \r\nThere is a small midline and right-sided protrusion of the \r\nintervertebral disc \r\nthat extends superiorly along the posterior margin of the L1 \r\nvertebral body.  \r\nThis does not contact the nerve roots.  The neural foramina \r\nappear normal. \r\n  \r\nAt L1-2 there is a small midline and right-sided disc protrusion \r\nthat \r\nencroaches on the thecal sac but does not contact the nerve \r\nroots.  This \r\nfragment extends superiorly along the posterior margin of the L1 \r\nbody.  The \r\nneural foramina appear normal. \r\n  \r\nAt L2-3, bulging of the disc and facet osteophytes produce \r\nencroachment on the \r\ntraversing L3 nerve roots bilaterally.  There is narrowing of \r\nthe right neural \r\nforamen due to facet osteophytes and intervertebral osteophytes. \r\n\r\n  \r\nAt L3-4, disc bulging and intervertebral osteophytes contact the \r\ntraversing \r\nright L4 nerve root.  The neural foramina are moderately \r\nnarrowed bilaterally. \r\n  \r\nAt L4-5, there is disc bulging but no evidence of nerve root \r\ncompression \r\nwithin the spinal canal.  There are prominent facet osteophytes \r\nbilaterally \r\nthe produce severe left and moderate right \r\n  \r\nAt L5-S1, there is elongation of the spinal canal due to the \r\nsubluxation of L5 \r\non S1.  There are prominent facet osteophytes bilaterally.  The \r\ncombination of \r\nthese factors and loss of height of the intervertebral disc as \r\nwell as disc \r\nbulging produces moderate -severe narrowing of the neural \r\nforamina \r\nbilaterally. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIMPRESSION: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n1. As discussed above, the vertebral, intervertebral disc, facet \r\nand left \r\npsoas muscle findings are likely due to a combination of \r\nscoliosis and chronic \r\ndegenerative disc disease, likely with inflammation on this \r\nbasis. \r\n2. The minimal change over time, vacuum phenomenon in the \r\nintervertebral discs \r\nand facet joints, absence of bone destruction and pattern of \r\nsignal intensity \r\nabnormalities argue against infection as the etiology. \r\n3. Degenerative disc disease produces mild encroachment on \r\nseveral nerve roots \r\nand more severe narrowing of the neural foramina at several \r\nlevels. \r\n\r\nEXAMINATION:  TIB/FIB (AP AND LAT) LEFT \r\n  \r\nINDICATION:  ___ year old woman with LLE edema, phlebolith seen \r\non US  // \r\nphlebolith seen on US? \r\n  \r\nTECHNIQUE:  Left tibia, fibula two views \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  Ultrasound lower extremity ___ \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nLeft knee arthroplasty.

She is\r\ncurrently on C2D12 of treatment with decitabine and presents \r\nwith\r\none day of confusion and chills. Neutropenic and afebrile with \r\nno infectious source identified, improved rapidly to baseline on \r\n___ and IV antibiotics were deescalated. \r\n\r\n#Altered mental status: Presented with word finding difficulty \r\nand generalized malaise with decreased PO intake, without true \r\nglobal sensorium deficit. 1 month prior during hospitalization \r\nhad been diagnosed with presumed osteomyelitis though imaging \r\nwas equivocal, and started on 1 month broad spectrum ABX course. \r\nOn this admission, ___ c/f meningitis, cefepime was increased to \r\nmeningitis dosing and ampicillin was added. Her home vanc and \r\nmica were continued. On ___ ___ the patient rapidly improved and \r\nmental status and symptoms were back to her baseline. Urine \r\nculture drawn in the ED (taken in bed-pan, not sterile) grew \r\nEnteroccus faecium pan-resistant, including ampicillin and \r\nvancomycin. The organism was not sensitive to any of the \r\nantibiotics that she was on, thus the organism was not treated, \r\nhowever she improved to baseline as above.

This was followed by sagittal and \r\naxial T1 \r\nimages obtained after the uneventful intravenous administration \r\nof 11 mL of \r\nGadavist  contrast agent. \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  Lumbar spine MR examinations ___ and ___.  \r\nCT abdomen and pelvis ___. \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nAgain seen is scoliosis convex to the left in the upper lumbar \r\nspine and to \r\nthe right in the lower lumbar spine.  Again seen is anterior \r\nsubluxation of L5 \r\non S1.  Again seen is ___ type 1 signal intensity change at \r\nL2-3.  This \r\nincludes a low signal of the vertebral endplates on the T1 \r\nweighted images and \r\nhigh signal of these endplates on the STIR images.  This finding \r\nhas not \r\nchanged since ___. \r\n  \r\nNew since ___ but unchanged since ___ are \r\nsimilar changes \r\nat the L4-5 interspace.  There is low signal of the endplates on \r\nthe T1 \r\nweighted images and high signal on the STIR images.  All of the \r\nlumbar discs \r\nare hypointense on the T2 weighted and STIR images as are the \r\ndiscs at the T9 \r\nthrough T12 level.  These are further manifestations of \r\ndegenerative disc \r\ndisease.  The endplates at L2-3 and at L4-5 enhance after \r\ncontrast \r\nadministration.  This is typical ___ type 1 change.  The \r\nintervertebral \r\ndiscs themselves do not enhance after contrast administration. \r\n  \r\nAgain seen are hypointensities in the intervertebral discs at \r\nmultiple levels. \r\nCorrelation with the CT abdomen and pelvis of ___ \r\ndemonstrates \r\nthat at every level from L2 through S1 included a vacuum \r\nphenomenon in the \r\nintervertebral disc. \r\n  \r\nThere is no evidence of abnormal intraspinal \r\ncontrast-enhancement. \r\n  \r\nThe psoas and spinal erector muscles are asymmetric and \r\ndemonstrate fatty \r\natrophy bilaterally. These changes are likely a result of the \r\nscoliosis.  Much \r\nof the hyperintensity seen on the pre and postcontrast axial T1 \r\nweighted \r\nimages through the medial portion of the left psoas muscle at \r\nthe lower L4 \r\nlevel is due to the fatty atrophy, rather than enhancement.  It \r\nis unclear \r\nwhether there is any abnormal enhancement of the left psoas \r\nmuscle, if so, it \r\nis minimal. \r\n  \r\nHypointensity on the T1 weighted images with enhancement after \r\ncontrast \r\nadministration involves the left side of the superior portion of \r\nthe L5 \r\nvertebral body and extends through the pedicle into the facet \r\njoint.  This \r\ncorrelates with mild hyperintensity in these regions on the STIR \r\nimages.  \r\nThere is slight induration of the adjacent fat between the \r\nvertebral body and \r\nthe psoas muscle, best seen on image 30 of series 7 with \r\nenhancement seen on \r\nimage 30 of series 9.  These findings may represent further \r\ninflammatory \r\nchange due to degenerative disease, or a local focus of \r\ninfection.  Note that \r\nthis appearance is quite similar to that of the ___ \r\nstudy.  The CT \r\nscans through the left facet joint at this level consistently \r\ndemonstrated a \r\nvacuum phenomenon, arguing strongly against infection of the \r\njoint.  There is \r\nno evidence of bone destruction on the CT scans, which would be \r\nhighly unusual \r\nif there were chronic osteomyelitis extending as far back as \r\n___.  \r\nThere is similar mild enhancement posteriorly along the left \r\nlamina at this \r\nlevel.  Overall, these findings again are more likely due to \r\ninflammatory \r\ndegenerative disease than infection. \r\n  \r\nThe combination of vacuum phenomenon, low signal of the disc on \r\nthe T2 \r\nweighted images, ___ type 1 signal intensity changes of the \r\nendplates and \r\nstability over time all argue in favor of degenerative disc \r\ndisease as the \r\ncause of these changes.  This constellation of findings would be \r\nextremely \r\nunlikely in the setting of discitis. \r\n  \r\nThere is a mild bulge of the T11-12 disc with no encroachment on \r\nthe spinal \r\ncord or neural foramina. \r\n  \r\nAt T12-L1 there is no encroachment on the cord or foramina.  \r\nIncidentally \r\nnoted is an apparent right renal cyst, better evaluated on the \r\nrecent CT scan. \r\nThere is a small midline and right-sided protrusion of the \r\nintervertebral disc \r\nthat extends superiorly along the posterior margin of the L1 \r\nvertebral body.  \r\nThis does not contact the nerve roots.  The neural foramina \r\nappear normal. \r\n  \r\nAt L1-2 there is a small midline and right-sided disc protrusion \r\nthat \r\nencroaches on the thecal sac but does not contact the nerve \r\nroots.  This \r\nfragment extends superiorly along the posterior margin of the L1 \r\nbody.  The \r\nneural foramina appear normal. \r\n  \r\nAt L2-3, bulging of the disc and facet osteophytes produce \r\nencroachment on the \r\ntraversing L3 nerve roots bilaterally.  There is narrowing of \r\nthe right neural \r\nforamen due to facet osteophytes and intervertebral osteophytes. \r\n\r\n  \r\nAt L3-4, disc bulging and intervertebral osteophytes contact the \r\ntraversing \r\nright L4 nerve root.  The neural foramina are moderately \r\nnarrowed bilaterally. \r\n  \r\nAt L4-5, there is disc bulging but no evidence of nerve root \r\ncompression \r\nwithin the spinal canal.  There are prominent facet osteophytes \r\nbilaterally \r\nthe produce severe left and moderate right \r\n  \r\nAt L5-S1, there is elongation of the spinal canal due to the \r\nsubluxation of L5 \r\non S1.  There are prominent facet osteophytes bilaterally.  The \r\ncombination of \r\nthese factors and loss of height of the intervertebral disc as \r\nwell as disc \r\nbulging produces moderate -severe narrowing of the neural \r\nforamina \r\nbilaterally. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIMPRESSION: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n1. As discussed above, the vertebral, intervertebral disc, facet \r\nand left \r\npsoas muscle findings are likely due to a combination of \r\nscoliosis and chronic \r\ndegenerative disc disease, likely with inflammation on this \r\nbasis. \r\n2. The minimal change over time, vacuum phenomenon in the \r\nintervertebral discs \r\nand facet joints, absence of bone destruction and pattern of \r\nsignal intensity \r\nabnormalities argue against infection as the etiology. \r\n3. Degenerative disc disease produces mild encroachment on \r\nseveral nerve roots \r\nand more severe narrowing of the neural foramina at several \r\nlevels. \r\n\r\nEXAMINATION:  TIB/FIB (AP AND LAT) LEFT \r\n  \r\nINDICATION:  ___ year old woman with LLE edema, phlebolith seen \r\non US  // \r\nphlebolith seen on US? \r\n  \r\nTECHNIQUE:  Left tibia, fibula two views \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  Ultrasound lower extremity ___ \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nLeft knee arthroplasty.

Neutropenic and afebrile with \r\nno infectious source identified, improved rapidly to baseline on \r\n___ and IV antibiotics were deescalated. \r\n\r\n#Altered mental status: Presented with word finding difficulty \r\nand generalized malaise with decreased PO intake, without true \r\nglobal sensorium deficit. 1 month prior during hospitalization \r\nhad been diagnosed with presumed osteomyelitis though imaging \r\nwas equivocal, and started on 1 month broad spectrum ABX course. \r\nOn this admission, ___ c/f meningitis, cefepime was increased to \r\nmeningitis dosing and ampicillin was added. Her home vanc and \r\nmica were continued. On ___ ___ the patient rapidly improved and \r\nmental status and symptoms were back to her baseline. Urine \r\nculture drawn in the ED (taken in bed-pan, not sterile) grew \r\nEnteroccus faecium pan-resistant, including ampicillin and \r\nvancomycin. The organism was not sensitive to any of the \r\nantibiotics that she was on, thus the organism was not treated, \r\nhowever she improved to baseline as above. Thus the UTI was \r\nlikely not the source of her AMS. In this light, she was not \r\nsent out on further antibiotics, but was counseled to return to \r\nthe hospital if she developed urinary symptoms or more \r\nconfusion. The true etiology is unclear. It may have been a \r\nviral infection or possibly cerebral hypoperfusion in the \r\nsetting of vascular pathology (h/o aneurysms). \r\n\r\n#UTI: see above for urine culture growing Enterococcus faecium. \r\n\r\n#LLE edema: Had a history of DVTs and was previously on \r\nrivaroxaban but this had been held for some time ___ \r\nthrombocytopenia.

After \r\nadministration of 11 mL of Gadavist intravenous contrast, axial \r\nimaging was \r\nperformed with gradient echo, FLAIR, diffusion, and T1 \r\ntechnique. Sagittal \r\nMPRAGE imaging was performed and re-formatted in axial and \r\ncoronal \r\norientations. \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  CT head ___ \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nThere is no evidence of acute infarction, or intracranial \r\nhemorrhage.  The \r\nventricles are normal in size without mass effect or midline \r\nshift.  There is \r\nno abnormal enhancement, enhancing mass, or leptomeningeal \r\ndisease.  There is \r\nminimal nonspecific scattered foci of hyperintense T2/FLAIR \r\nsignal changes \r\nwithin the subcortical and periventricular white matter, which \r\nis likely a \r\nsequela of chronic small vessel microangiopathy.

This was followed by sagittal and \r\naxial T1 \r\nimages obtained after the uneventful intravenous administration \r\nof 11 mL of \r\nGadavist  contrast agent. \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  Lumbar spine MR examinations ___ and ___.  \r\nCT abdomen and pelvis ___. \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nAgain seen is scoliosis convex to the left in the upper lumbar \r\nspine and to \r\nthe right in the lower lumbar spine.  Again seen is anterior \r\nsubluxation of L5 \r\non S1.  Again seen is ___ type 1 signal intensity change at \r\nL2-3.  This \r\nincludes a low signal of the vertebral endplates on the T1 \r\nweighted images and \r\nhigh signal of these endplates on the STIR images.  This finding \r\nhas not \r\nchanged since ___. \r\n  \r\nNew since ___ but unchanged since ___ are \r\nsimilar changes \r\nat the L4-5 interspace.  There is low signal of the endplates on \r\nthe T1 \r\nweighted images and high signal on the STIR images.  All of the \r\nlumbar discs \r\nare hypointense on the T2 weighted and STIR images as are the \r\ndiscs at the T9 \r\nthrough T12 level.  These are further manifestations of \r\ndegenerative disc \r\ndisease.  The endplates at L2-3 and at L4-5 enhance after \r\ncontrast \r\nadministration.  This is typical ___ type 1 change.  The \r\nintervertebral \r\ndiscs themselves do not enhance after contrast administration. \r\n  \r\nAgain seen are hypointensities in the intervertebral discs at \r\nmultiple levels. \r\nCorrelation with the CT abdomen and pelvis of ___ \r\ndemonstrates \r\nthat at every level from L2 through S1 included a vacuum \r\nphenomenon in the \r\nintervertebral disc. \r\n  \r\nThere is no evidence of abnormal intraspinal \r\ncontrast-enhancement. \r\n  \r\nThe psoas and spinal erector muscles are asymmetric and \r\ndemonstrate fatty \r\natrophy bilaterally. These changes are likely a result of the \r\nscoliosis.  Much \r\nof the hyperintensity seen on the pre and postcontrast axial T1 \r\nweighted \r\nimages through the medial portion of the left psoas muscle at \r\nthe lower L4 \r\nlevel is due to the fatty atrophy, rather than enhancement.  It \r\nis unclear \r\nwhether there is any abnormal enhancement of the left psoas \r\nmuscle, if so, it \r\nis minimal. \r\n  \r\nHypointensity on the T1 weighted images with enhancement after \r\ncontrast \r\nadministration involves the left side of the superior portion of \r\nthe L5 \r\nvertebral body and extends through the pedicle into the facet \r\njoint.  This \r\ncorrelates with mild hyperintensity in these regions on the STIR \r\nimages.  \r\nThere is slight induration of the adjacent fat between the \r\nvertebral body and \r\nthe psoas muscle, best seen on image 30 of series 7 with \r\nenhancement seen on \r\nimage 30 of series 9.  These findings may represent further \r\ninflammatory \r\nchange due to degenerative disease, or a local focus of \r\ninfection.  Note that \r\nthis appearance is quite similar to that of the ___ \r\nstudy.  The CT \r\nscans through the left facet joint at this level consistently \r\ndemonstrated a \r\nvacuum phenomenon, arguing strongly against infection of the \r\njoint.  There is \r\nno evidence of bone destruction on the CT scans, which would be \r\nhighly unusual \r\nif there were chronic osteomyelitis extending as far back as \r\n___.  \r\nThere is similar mild enhancement posteriorly along the left \r\nlamina at this \r\nlevel.  Overall, these findings again are more likely due to \r\ninflammatory \r\ndegenerative disease than infection. \r\n  \r\nThe combination of vacuum phenomenon, low signal of the disc on \r\nthe T2 \r\nweighted images, ___ type 1 signal intensity changes of the \r\nendplates and \r\nstability over time all argue in favor of degenerative disc \r\ndisease as the \r\ncause of these changes.  This constellation of findings would be \r\nextremely \r\nunlikely in the setting of discitis. \r\n  \r\nThere is a mild bulge of the T11-12 disc with no encroachment on \r\nthe spinal \r\ncord or neural foramina. \r\n  \r\nAt T12-L1 there is no encroachment on the cord or foramina.  \r\nIncidentally \r\nnoted is an apparent right renal cyst, better evaluated on the \r\nrecent CT scan. \r\nThere is a small midline and right-sided protrusion of the \r\nintervertebral disc \r\nthat extends superiorly along the posterior margin of the L1 \r\nvertebral body.  \r\nThis does not contact the nerve roots.  The neural foramina \r\nappear normal. \r\n  \r\nAt L1-2 there is a small midline and right-sided disc protrusion \r\nthat \r\nencroaches on the thecal sac but does not contact the nerve \r\nroots.  This \r\nfragment extends superiorly along the posterior margin of the L1 \r\nbody.  The \r\nneural foramina appear normal. \r\n  \r\nAt L2-3, bulging of the disc and facet osteophytes produce \r\nencroachment on the \r\ntraversing L3 nerve roots bilaterally.  There is narrowing of \r\nthe right neural \r\nforamen due to facet osteophytes and intervertebral osteophytes. \r\n\r\n  \r\nAt L3-4, disc bulging and intervertebral osteophytes contact the \r\ntraversing \r\nright L4 nerve root.  The neural foramina are moderately \r\nnarrowed bilaterally. \r\n  \r\nAt L4-5, there is disc bulging but no evidence of nerve root \r\ncompression \r\nwithin the spinal canal.  There are prominent facet osteophytes \r\nbilaterally \r\nthe produce severe left and moderate right \r\n  \r\nAt L5-S1, there is elongation of the spinal canal due to the \r\nsubluxation of L5 \r\non S1.  There are prominent facet osteophytes bilaterally.  The \r\ncombination of \r\nthese factors and loss of height of the intervertebral disc as \r\nwell as disc \r\nbulging produces moderate -severe narrowing of the neural \r\nforamina \r\nbilaterally. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIMPRESSION: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n1. As discussed above, the vertebral, intervertebral disc, facet \r\nand left \r\npsoas muscle findings are likely due to a combination of \r\nscoliosis and chronic \r\ndegenerative disc disease, likely with inflammation on this \r\nbasis. \r\n2. The minimal change over time, vacuum phenomenon in the \r\nintervertebral discs \r\nand facet joints, absence of bone destruction and pattern of \r\nsignal intensity \r\nabnormalities argue against infection as the etiology. \r\n3. Degenerative disc disease produces mild encroachment on \r\nseveral nerve roots \r\nand more severe narrowing of the neural foramina at several \r\nlevels. \r\n\r\nEXAMINATION:  TIB/FIB (AP AND LAT) LEFT \r\n  \r\nINDICATION:  ___ year old woman with LLE edema, phlebolith seen \r\non US  // \r\nphlebolith seen on US? \r\n  \r\nTECHNIQUE:  Left tibia, fibula two views \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  Ultrasound lower extremity ___ \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nLeft knee arthroplasty.

Neutropenic and afebrile with \r\nno infectious source identified, improved rapidly to baseline on \r\n___ and IV antibiotics were deescalated. \r\n\r\n#Altered mental status: Presented with word finding difficulty \r\nand generalized malaise with decreased PO intake, without true \r\nglobal sensorium deficit. 1 month prior during hospitalization \r\nhad been diagnosed with presumed osteomyelitis though imaging \r\nwas equivocal, and started on 1 month broad spectrum ABX course. \r\nOn this admission, ___ c/f meningitis, cefepime was increased to \r\nmeningitis dosing and ampicillin was added. Her home vanc and \r\nmica were continued. On ___ ___ the patient rapidly improved and \r\nmental status and symptoms were back to her baseline. Urine \r\nculture drawn in the ED (taken in bed-pan, not sterile) grew \r\nEnteroccus faecium pan-resistant, including ampicillin and \r\nvancomycin. The organism was not sensitive to any of the \r\nantibiotics that she was on, thus the organism was not treated, \r\nhowever she improved to baseline as above. Thus the UTI was \r\nlikely not the source of her AMS. In this light, she was not \r\nsent out on further antibiotics, but was counseled to return to \r\nthe hospital if she developed urinary symptoms or more \r\nconfusion. The true etiology is unclear. It may have been a \r\nviral infection or possibly cerebral hypoperfusion in the \r\nsetting of vascular pathology (h/o aneurysms). \r\n\r\n#UTI: see above for urine culture growing Enterococcus faecium. \r\n\r\n#LLE edema: Had a history of DVTs and was previously on \r\nrivaroxaban but this had been held for some time ___ \r\nthrombocytopenia.

      "text": "These findings may represent further \ninflammatory \nchange due to degenerative disease, or a local focus of \ninfection. Note that \nthis appearance is quite similar to that of the ___ \nstudy. The CT \nscans through the left facet joint at this level consistently \ndemonstrated a \nvacuum phenomenon, arguing strongly against infection of the \njoint. There is \nno evidence of bone destruction on the CT scans, which would be \nhighly unusual \nif there were chronic osteomyelitis extending as far back as \n___. There is similar mild enhancement posteriorly along the left \nlamina at this \nlevel. Overall, these findings again are more likely due to \ninflammatory \ndegenerative disease than infection. The combination of vacuum phenomenon, low signal of the disc on \nthe T2 \nweighted images, ___ type 1 signal intensity changes of the \nendplates and \nstability over time all argue in favor of degenerative disc \ndisease as the \ncause of these changes. This constellation of findings would be \nextremely \nunlikely in the setting of discitis. There is a mild bulge of the T11-12 disc with no encroachment on \nthe spinal \ncord or neural foramina. At T12-L1 there is no encroachment on the cord or foramina. Incidentally \nnoted is an apparent right renal cyst, better evaluated on the \nrecent CT scan. There is a small midline and right-sided protrusion of the \nintervertebral disc \nthat extends superiorly along the posterior margin of the L1 \nvertebral body. This does not contact the nerve roots. The neural foramina \nappear normal. At L1-2 there is a small midline and right-sided disc protrusion \nthat \nencroaches on the thecal sac but does not contact the nerve \nroots. This \nfragment extends superiorly along the posterior margin of the L1 \nbody. The \nneural foramina appear normal. At L2-3, bulging of the disc and facet osteophytes produce \nencroachment on the \ntraversing L3 nerve roots bilaterally. There is narrowing of \nthe right neural \nforamen due to facet osteophytes and intervertebral osteophytes. At L3-4, disc bulging and intervertebral osteophytes contact the \ntraversing \nright L4 nerve root. The neural foramina are moderately \nnarrowed bilaterally. At L4-5, there is disc bulging but no evidence of nerve root \ncompression \nwithin the spinal canal. There are prominent facet osteophytes \nbilaterally \nthe produce severe left and moderate right \n  \nAt L5-S1, there is elongation of the spinal canal due to the \nsubluxation of L5 \non S1. There are prominent facet osteophytes bilaterally. The \ncombination of \nthese factors and loss of height of the intervertebral disc as \nwell as disc \nbulging produces moderate -severe narrowing of the neural \nforamina \nbilaterally.",

Evaluate for hemorrhage. \r\n  \r\nTECHNIQUE:  Sagittal and axial T1 weighted imaging were \r\nperformed. After \r\nadministration of 11 mL of Gadavist intravenous contrast, axial \r\nimaging was \r\nperformed with gradient echo, FLAIR, diffusion, and T1 \r\ntechnique. Sagittal \r\nMPRAGE imaging was performed and re-formatted in axial and \r\ncoronal \r\norientations. \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  CT head ___ \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nThere is no evidence of acute infarction, or intracranial \r\nhemorrhage.  The \r\nventricles are normal in size without mass effect or midline \r\nshift.  There is \r\nno abnormal enhancement, enhancing mass, or leptomeningeal \r\ndisease.  There is \r\nminimal nonspecific scattered foci of hyperintense T2/FLAIR \r\nsignal changes \r\nwithin the subcortical and periventricular white matter, which \r\nis likely a \r\nsequela of chronic small vessel microangiopathy.

This was followed by sagittal and \r\naxial T1 \r\nimages obtained after the uneventful intravenous administration \r\nof 11 mL of \r\nGadavist  contrast agent. \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  Lumbar spine MR examinations ___ and ___.  \r\nCT abdomen and pelvis ___. \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nAgain seen is scoliosis convex to the left in the upper lumbar \r\nspine and to \r\nthe right in the lower lumbar spine.  Again seen is anterior \r\nsubluxation of L5 \r\non S1.  Again seen is ___ type 1 signal intensity change at \r\nL2-3.  This \r\nincludes a low signal of the vertebral endplates on the T1 \r\nweighted images and \r\nhigh signal of these endplates on the STIR images.  This finding \r\nhas not \r\nchanged since ___. \r\n  \r\nNew since ___ but unchanged since ___ are \r\nsimilar changes \r\nat the L4-5 interspace.  There is low signal of the endplates on \r\nthe T1 \r\nweighted images and high signal on the STIR images.  All of the \r\nlumbar discs \r\nare hypointense on the T2 weighted and STIR images as are the \r\ndiscs at the T9 \r\nthrough T12 level.  These are further manifestations of \r\ndegenerative disc \r\ndisease.  The endplates at L2-3 and at L4-5 enhance after \r\ncontrast \r\nadministration.  This is typical ___ type 1 change.  The \r\nintervertebral \r\ndiscs themselves do not enhance after contrast administration. \r\n  \r\nAgain seen are hypointensities in the intervertebral discs at \r\nmultiple levels. \r\nCorrelation with the CT abdomen and pelvis of ___ \r\ndemonstrates \r\nthat at every level from L2 through S1 included a vacuum \r\nphenomenon in the \r\nintervertebral disc. \r\n  \r\nThere is no evidence of abnormal intraspinal \r\ncontrast-enhancement. \r\n  \r\nThe psoas and spinal erector muscles are asymmetric and \r\ndemonstrate fatty \r\natrophy bilaterally. These changes are likely a result of the \r\nscoliosis.  Much \r\nof the hyperintensity seen on the pre and postcontrast axial T1 \r\nweighted \r\nimages through the medial portion of the left psoas muscle at \r\nthe lower L4 \r\nlevel is due to the fatty atrophy, rather than enhancement.  It \r\nis unclear \r\nwhether there is any abnormal enhancement of the left psoas \r\nmuscle, if so, it \r\nis minimal. \r\n  \r\nHypointensity on the T1 weighted images with enhancement after \r\ncontrast \r\nadministration involves the left side of the superior portion of \r\nthe L5 \r\nvertebral body and extends through the pedicle into the facet \r\njoint.  This \r\ncorrelates with mild hyperintensity in these regions on the STIR \r\nimages.  \r\nThere is slight induration of the adjacent fat between the \r\nvertebral body and \r\nthe psoas muscle, best seen on image 30 of series 7 with \r\nenhancement seen on \r\nimage 30 of series 9.  These findings may represent further \r\ninflammatory \r\nchange due to degenerative disease, or a local focus of \r\ninfection.  Note that \r\nthis appearance is quite similar to that of the ___ \r\nstudy.  The CT \r\nscans through the left facet joint at this level consistently \r\ndemonstrated a \r\nvacuum phenomenon, arguing strongly against infection of the \r\njoint.  There is \r\nno evidence of bone destruction on the CT scans, which would be \r\nhighly unusual \r\nif there were chronic osteomyelitis extending as far back as \r\n___.  \r\nThere is similar mild enhancement posteriorly along the left \r\nlamina at this \r\nlevel.  Overall, these findings again are more likely due to \r\ninflammatory \r\ndegenerative disease than infection. \r\n  \r\nThe combination of vacuum phenomenon, low signal of the disc on \r\nthe T2 \r\nweighted images, ___ type 1 signal intensity changes of the \r\nendplates and \r\nstability over time all argue in favor of degenerative disc \r\ndisease as the \r\ncause of these changes.  This constellation of findings would be \r\nextremely \r\nunlikely in the setting of discitis. \r\n  \r\nThere is a mild bulge of the T11-12 disc with no encroachment on \r\nthe spinal \r\ncord or neural foramina. \r\n  \r\nAt T12-L1 there is no encroachment on the cord or foramina.  \r\nIncidentally \r\nnoted is an apparent right renal cyst, better evaluated on the \r\nrecent CT scan. \r\nThere is a small midline and right-sided protrusion of the \r\nintervertebral disc \r\nthat extends superiorly along the posterior margin of the L1 \r\nvertebral body.  \r\nThis does not contact the nerve roots.  The neural foramina \r\nappear normal. \r\n  \r\nAt L1-2 there is a small midline and right-sided disc protrusion \r\nthat \r\nencroaches on the thecal sac but does not contact the nerve \r\nroots.  This \r\nfragment extends superiorly along the posterior margin of the L1 \r\nbody.  The \r\nneural foramina appear normal. \r\n  \r\nAt L2-3, bulging of the disc and facet osteophytes produce \r\nencroachment on the \r\ntraversing L3 nerve roots bilaterally.  There is narrowing of \r\nthe right neural \r\nforamen due to facet osteophytes and intervertebral osteophytes. \r\n\r\n  \r\nAt L3-4, disc bulging and intervertebral osteophytes contact the \r\ntraversing \r\nright L4 nerve root.  The neural foramina are moderately \r\nnarrowed bilaterally. \r\n  \r\nAt L4-5, there is disc bulging but no evidence of nerve root \r\ncompression \r\nwithin the spinal canal.  There are prominent facet osteophytes \r\nbilaterally \r\nthe produce severe left and moderate right \r\n  \r\nAt L5-S1, there is elongation of the spinal canal due to the \r\nsubluxation of L5 \r\non S1.  There are prominent facet osteophytes bilaterally.  The \r\ncombination of \r\nthese factors and loss of height of the intervertebral disc as \r\nwell as disc \r\nbulging produces moderate -severe narrowing of the neural \r\nforamina \r\nbilaterally. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIMPRESSION: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n1. As discussed above, the vertebral, intervertebral disc, facet \r\nand left \r\npsoas muscle findings are likely due to a combination of \r\nscoliosis and chronic \r\ndegenerative disc disease, likely with inflammation on this \r\nbasis. \r\n2. The minimal change over time, vacuum phenomenon in the \r\nintervertebral discs \r\nand facet joints, absence of bone destruction and pattern of \r\nsignal intensity \r\nabnormalities argue against infection as the etiology. \r\n3. Degenerative disc disease produces mild encroachment on \r\nseveral nerve roots \r\nand more severe narrowing of the neural foramina at several \r\nlevels. \r\n\r\nEXAMINATION:  TIB/FIB (AP AND LAT) LEFT \r\n  \r\nINDICATION:  ___ year old woman with LLE edema, phlebolith seen \r\non US  // \r\nphlebolith seen on US? \r\n  \r\nTECHNIQUE:  Left tibia, fibula two views \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  Ultrasound lower extremity ___ \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nLeft knee arthroplasty.

She is\r\ncurrently on C2D12 of treatment with decitabine and presents \r\nwith\r\none day of confusion and chills. Neutropenic and afebrile with \r\nno infectious source identified, improved rapidly to baseline on \r\n___ and IV antibiotics were deescalated. \r\n\r\n#Altered mental status: Presented with word finding difficulty \r\nand generalized malaise with decreased PO intake, without true \r\nglobal sensorium deficit. 1 month prior during hospitalization \r\nhad been diagnosed with presumed osteomyelitis though imaging \r\nwas equivocal, and started on 1 month broad spectrum ABX course. \r\nOn this admission, ___ c/f meningitis, cefepime was increased to \r\nmeningitis dosing and ampicillin was added. Her home vanc and \r\nmica were continued. On ___ ___ the patient rapidly improved and \r\nmental status and symptoms were back to her baseline. Urine \r\nculture drawn in the ED (taken in bed-pan, not sterile) grew \r\nEnteroccus faecium pan-resistant, including ampicillin and \r\nvancomycin. The organism was not sensitive to any of the \r\nantibiotics that she was on, thus the organism was not treated, \r\nhowever she improved to baseline as above. Thus the UTI was \r\nlikely not the source of her AMS. In this light, she was not \r\nsent out on further antibiotics, but was counseled to return to \r\nthe hospital if she developed urinary symptoms or more \r\nconfusion. The true etiology is unclear. It may have been a \r\nviral infection or possibly cerebral hypoperfusion in the \r\nsetting of vascular pathology (h/o aneurysms). \r\n\r\n#UTI: see above for urine culture growing Enterococcus faecium. \r\n\r\n#LLE edema: Had a history of DVTs and was previously on \r\nrivaroxaban but this had been held for some time ___ \r\nthrombocytopenia.

Evaluate for hemorrhage. \r\n  \r\nTECHNIQUE:  Sagittal and axial T1 weighted imaging were \r\nperformed. After \r\nadministration of 11 mL of Gadavist intravenous contrast, axial \r\nimaging was \r\nperformed with gradient echo, FLAIR, diffusion, and T1 \r\ntechnique. Sagittal \r\nMPRAGE imaging was performed and re-formatted in axial and \r\ncoronal \r\norientations. \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  CT head ___ \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nThere is no evidence of acute infarction, or intracranial \r\nhemorrhage.  The \r\nventricles are normal in size without mass effect or midline \r\nshift.  There is \r\nno abnormal enhancement, enhancing mass, or leptomeningeal \r\ndisease.  There is \r\nminimal nonspecific scattered foci of hyperintense T2/FLAIR \r\nsignal changes \r\nwithin the subcortical and periventricular white matter, which \r\nis likely a \r\nsequela of chronic small vessel microangiopathy.

This was followed by sagittal and \r\naxial T1 \r\nimages obtained after the uneventful intravenous administration \r\nof 11 mL of \r\nGadavist  contrast agent. \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  Lumbar spine MR examinations ___ and ___.  \r\nCT abdomen and pelvis ___. \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nAgain seen is scoliosis convex to the left in the upper lumbar \r\nspine and to \r\nthe right in the lower lumbar spine.  Again seen is anterior \r\nsubluxation of L5 \r\non S1.  Again seen is ___ type 1 signal intensity change at \r\nL2-3.  This \r\nincludes a low signal of the vertebral endplates on the T1 \r\nweighted images and \r\nhigh signal of these endplates on the STIR images.  This finding \r\nhas not \r\nchanged since ___. \r\n  \r\nNew since ___ but unchanged since ___ are \r\nsimilar changes \r\nat the L4-5 interspace.  There is low signal of the endplates on \r\nthe T1 \r\nweighted images and high signal on the STIR images.  All of the \r\nlumbar discs \r\nare hypointense on the T2 weighted and STIR images as are the \r\ndiscs at the T9 \r\nthrough T12 level.  These are further manifestations of \r\ndegenerative disc \r\ndisease.  The endplates at L2-3 and at L4-5 enhance after \r\ncontrast \r\nadministration.  This is typical ___ type 1 change.  The \r\nintervertebral \r\ndiscs themselves do not enhance after contrast administration. \r\n  \r\nAgain seen are hypointensities in the intervertebral discs at \r\nmultiple levels. \r\nCorrelation with the CT abdomen and pelvis of ___ \r\ndemonstrates \r\nthat at every level from L2 through S1 included a vacuum \r\nphenomenon in the \r\nintervertebral disc. \r\n  \r\nThere is no evidence of abnormal intraspinal \r\ncontrast-enhancement. \r\n  \r\nThe psoas and spinal erector muscles are asymmetric and \r\ndemonstrate fatty \r\natrophy bilaterally. These changes are likely a result of the \r\nscoliosis.  Much \r\nof the hyperintensity seen on the pre and postcontrast axial T1 \r\nweighted \r\nimages through the medial portion of the left psoas muscle at \r\nthe lower L4 \r\nlevel is due to the fatty atrophy, rather than enhancement.  It \r\nis unclear \r\nwhether there is any abnormal enhancement of the left psoas \r\nmuscle, if so, it \r\nis minimal. \r\n  \r\nHypointensity on the T1 weighted images with enhancement after \r\ncontrast \r\nadministration involves the left side of the superior portion of \r\nthe L5 \r\nvertebral body and extends through the pedicle into the facet \r\njoint.  This \r\ncorrelates with mild hyperintensity in these regions on the STIR \r\nimages.  \r\nThere is slight induration of the adjacent fat between the \r\nvertebral body and \r\nthe psoas muscle, best seen on image 30 of series 7 with \r\nenhancement seen on \r\nimage 30 of series 9.  These findings may represent further \r\ninflammatory \r\nchange due to degenerative disease, or a local focus of \r\ninfection.  Note that \r\nthis appearance is quite similar to that of the ___ \r\nstudy.  The CT \r\nscans through the left facet joint at this level consistently \r\ndemonstrated a \r\nvacuum phenomenon, arguing strongly against infection of the \r\njoint.  There is \r\nno evidence of bone destruction on the CT scans, which would be \r\nhighly unusual \r\nif there were chronic osteomyelitis extending as far back as \r\n___.  \r\nThere is similar mild enhancement posteriorly along the left \r\nlamina at this \r\nlevel.  Overall, these findings again are more likely due to \r\ninflammatory \r\ndegenerative disease than infection. \r\n  \r\nThe combination of vacuum phenomenon, low signal of the disc on \r\nthe T2 \r\nweighted images, ___ type 1 signal intensity changes of the \r\nendplates and \r\nstability over time all argue in favor of degenerative disc \r\ndisease as the \r\ncause of these changes.  This constellation of findings would be \r\nextremely \r\nunlikely in the setting of discitis. \r\n  \r\nThere is a mild bulge of the T11-12 disc with no encroachment on \r\nthe spinal \r\ncord or neural foramina. \r\n  \r\nAt T12-L1 there is no encroachment on the cord or foramina.  \r\nIncidentally \r\nnoted is an apparent right renal cyst, better evaluated on the \r\nrecent CT scan. \r\nThere is a small midline and right-sided protrusion of the \r\nintervertebral disc \r\nthat extends superiorly along the posterior margin of the L1 \r\nvertebral body.  \r\nThis does not contact the nerve roots.  The neural foramina \r\nappear normal. \r\n  \r\nAt L1-2 there is a small midline and right-sided disc protrusion \r\nthat \r\nencroaches on the thecal sac but does not contact the nerve \r\nroots.  This \r\nfragment extends superiorly along the posterior margin of the L1 \r\nbody.  The \r\nneural foramina appear normal. \r\n  \r\nAt L2-3, bulging of the disc and facet osteophytes produce \r\nencroachment on the \r\ntraversing L3 nerve roots bilaterally.  There is narrowing of \r\nthe right neural \r\nforamen due to facet osteophytes and intervertebral osteophytes. \r\n\r\n  \r\nAt L3-4, disc bulging and intervertebral osteophytes contact the \r\ntraversing \r\nright L4 nerve root.  The neural foramina are moderately \r\nnarrowed bilaterally. \r\n  \r\nAt L4-5, there is disc bulging but no evidence of nerve root \r\ncompression \r\nwithin the spinal canal.  There are prominent facet osteophytes \r\nbilaterally \r\nthe produce severe left and moderate right \r\n  \r\nAt L5-S1, there is elongation of the spinal canal due to the \r\nsubluxation of L5 \r\non S1.  There are prominent facet osteophytes bilaterally.  The \r\ncombination of \r\nthese factors and loss of height of the intervertebral disc as \r\nwell as disc \r\nbulging produces moderate -severe narrowing of the neural \r\nforamina \r\nbilaterally. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIMPRESSION: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n1. As discussed above, the vertebral, intervertebral disc, facet \r\nand left \r\npsoas muscle findings are likely due to a combination of \r\nscoliosis and chronic \r\ndegenerative disc disease, likely with inflammation on this \r\nbasis. \r\n2. The minimal change over time, vacuum phenomenon in the \r\nintervertebral discs \r\nand facet joints, absence of bone destruction and pattern of \r\nsignal intensity \r\nabnormalities argue against infection as the etiology. \r\n3. Degenerative disc disease produces mild encroachment on \r\nseveral nerve roots \r\nand more severe narrowing of the neural foramina at several \r\nlevels. \r\n\r\nEXAMINATION:  TIB/FIB (AP AND LAT) LEFT \r\n  \r\nINDICATION:  ___ year old woman with LLE edema, phlebolith seen \r\non US  // \r\nphlebolith seen on US? \r\n  \r\nTECHNIQUE:  Left tibia, fibula two views \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  Ultrasound lower extremity ___ \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nLeft knee arthroplasty.

Neutropenic and afebrile with \r\nno infectious source identified, improved rapidly to baseline on \r\n___ and IV antibiotics were deescalated. \r\n\r\n#Altered mental status: Presented with word finding difficulty \r\nand generalized malaise with decreased PO intake, without true \r\nglobal sensorium deficit. 1 month prior during hospitalization \r\nhad been diagnosed with presumed osteomyelitis though imaging \r\nwas equivocal, and started on 1 month broad spectrum ABX course. \r\nOn this admission, ___ c/f meningitis, cefepime was increased to \r\nmeningitis dosing and ampicillin was added. Her home vanc and \r\nmica were continued. On ___ ___ the patient rapidly improved and \r\nmental status and symptoms were back to her baseline. Urine \r\nculture drawn in the ED (taken in bed-pan, not sterile) grew \r\nEnteroccus faecium pan-resistant, including ampicillin and \r\nvancomycin. The organism was not sensitive to any of the \r\nantibiotics that she was on, thus the organism was not treated, \r\nhowever she improved to baseline as above. Thus the UTI was \r\nlikely not the source of her AMS. In this light, she was not \r\nsent out on further antibiotics, but was counseled to return to \r\nthe hospital if she developed urinary symptoms or more \r\nconfusion. The true etiology is unclear. It may have been a \r\nviral infection or possibly cerebral hypoperfusion in the \r\nsetting of vascular pathology (h/o aneurysms). \r\n\r\n#UTI: see above for urine culture growing Enterococcus faecium. \r\n\r\n#LLE edema: Had a history of DVTs and was previously on \r\nrivaroxaban but this had been held for some time ___ \r\nthrombocytopenia.

Evaluate for hemorrhage. \r\n  \r\nTECHNIQUE:  Sagittal and axial T1 weighted imaging were \r\nperformed. After \r\nadministration of 11 mL of Gadavist intravenous contrast, axial \r\nimaging was \r\nperformed with gradient echo, FLAIR, diffusion, and T1 \r\ntechnique. Sagittal \r\nMPRAGE imaging was performed and re-formatted in axial and \r\ncoronal \r\norientations. \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  CT head ___ \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nThere is no evidence of acute infarction, or intracranial \r\nhemorrhage.  The \r\nventricles are normal in size without mass effect or midline \r\nshift.  There is \r\nno abnormal enhancement, enhancing mass, or leptomeningeal \r\ndisease.  There is \r\nminimal nonspecific scattered foci of hyperintense T2/FLAIR \r\nsignal changes \r\nwithin the subcortical and periventricular white matter, which \r\nis likely a \r\nsequela of chronic small vessel microangiopathy.  The dural \r\nvenous sinuses \r\nappear patent on post-contrast MPRAGE images.  The paranasal \r\nsinuses appear \r\nclear.

This was followed by sagittal and \r\naxial T1 \r\nimages obtained after the uneventful intravenous administration \r\nof 11 mL of \r\nGadavist  contrast agent. \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  Lumbar spine MR examinations ___ and ___.  \r\nCT abdomen and pelvis ___. \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nAgain seen is scoliosis convex to the left in the upper lumbar \r\nspine and to \r\nthe right in the lower lumbar spine.  Again seen is anterior \r\nsubluxation of L5 \r\non S1.  Again seen is ___ type 1 signal intensity change at \r\nL2-3.  This \r\nincludes a low signal of the vertebral endplates on the T1 \r\nweighted images and \r\nhigh signal of these endplates on the STIR images.  This finding \r\nhas not \r\nchanged since ___. \r\n  \r\nNew since ___ but unchanged since ___ are \r\nsimilar changes \r\nat the L4-5 interspace.  There is low signal of the endplates on \r\nthe T1 \r\nweighted images and high signal on the STIR images.  All of the \r\nlumbar discs \r\nare hypointense on the T2 weighted and STIR images as are the \r\ndiscs at the T9 \r\nthrough T12 level.  These are further manifestations of \r\ndegenerative disc \r\ndisease.  The endplates at L2-3 and at L4-5 enhance after \r\ncontrast \r\nadministration.  This is typical ___ type 1 change.  The \r\nintervertebral \r\ndiscs themselves do not enhance after contrast administration. \r\n  \r\nAgain seen are hypointensities in the intervertebral discs at \r\nmultiple levels. \r\nCorrelation with the CT abdomen and pelvis of ___ \r\ndemonstrates \r\nthat at every level from L2 through S1 included a vacuum \r\nphenomenon in the \r\nintervertebral disc. \r\n  \r\nThere is no evidence of abnormal intraspinal \r\ncontrast-enhancement. \r\n  \r\nThe psoas and spinal erector muscles are asymmetric and \r\ndemonstrate fatty \r\natrophy bilaterally. These changes are likely a result of the \r\nscoliosis.  Much \r\nof the hyperintensity seen on the pre and postcontrast axial T1 \r\nweighted \r\nimages through the medial portion of the left psoas muscle at \r\nthe lower L4 \r\nlevel is due to the fatty atrophy, rather than enhancement.  It \r\nis unclear \r\nwhether there is any abnormal enhancement of the left psoas \r\nmuscle, if so, it \r\nis minimal. \r\n  \r\nHypointensity on the T1 weighted images with enhancement after \r\ncontrast \r\nadministration involves the left side of the superior portion of \r\nthe L5 \r\nvertebral body and extends through the pedicle into the facet \r\njoint.  This \r\ncorrelates with mild hyperintensity in these regions on the STIR \r\nimages.  \r\nThere is slight induration of the adjacent fat between the \r\nvertebral body and \r\nthe psoas muscle, best seen on image 30 of series 7 with \r\nenhancement seen on \r\nimage 30 of series 9.  These findings may represent further \r\ninflammatory \r\nchange due to degenerative disease, or a local focus of \r\ninfection.  Note that \r\nthis appearance is quite similar to that of the ___ \r\nstudy.  The CT \r\nscans through the left facet joint at this level consistently \r\ndemonstrated a \r\nvacuum phenomenon, arguing strongly against infection of the \r\njoint.  There is \r\nno evidence of bone destruction on the CT scans, which would be \r\nhighly unusual \r\nif there were chronic osteomyelitis extending as far back as \r\n___.  \r\nThere is similar mild enhancement posteriorly along the left \r\nlamina at this \r\nlevel.  Overall, these findings again are more likely due to \r\ninflammatory \r\ndegenerative disease than infection. \r\n  \r\nThe combination of vacuum phenomenon, low signal of the disc on \r\nthe T2 \r\nweighted images, ___ type 1 signal intensity changes of the \r\nendplates and \r\nstability over time all argue in favor of degenerative disc \r\ndisease as the \r\ncause of these changes.  This constellation of findings would be \r\nextremely \r\nunlikely in the setting of discitis. \r\n  \r\nThere is a mild bulge of the T11-12 disc with no encroachment on \r\nthe spinal \r\ncord or neural foramina. \r\n  \r\nAt T12-L1 there is no encroachment on the cord or foramina.  \r\nIncidentally \r\nnoted is an apparent right renal cyst, better evaluated on the \r\nrecent CT scan. \r\nThere is a small midline and right-sided protrusion of the \r\nintervertebral disc \r\nthat extends superiorly along the posterior margin of the L1 \r\nvertebral body.  \r\nThis does not contact the nerve roots.  The neural foramina \r\nappear normal. \r\n  \r\nAt L1-2 there is a small midline and right-sided disc protrusion \r\nthat \r\nencroaches on the thecal sac but does not contact the nerve \r\nroots.  This \r\nfragment extends superiorly along the posterior margin of the L1 \r\nbody.  The \r\nneural foramina appear normal. \r\n  \r\nAt L2-3, bulging of the disc and facet osteophytes produce \r\nencroachment on the \r\ntraversing L3 nerve roots bilaterally.  There is narrowing of \r\nthe right neural \r\nforamen due to facet osteophytes and intervertebral osteophytes. \r\n\r\n  \r\nAt L3-4, disc bulging and intervertebral osteophytes contact the \r\ntraversing \r\nright L4 nerve root.  The neural foramina are moderately \r\nnarrowed bilaterally. \r\n  \r\nAt L4-5, there is disc bulging but no evidence of nerve root \r\ncompression \r\nwithin the spinal canal.  There are prominent facet osteophytes \r\nbilaterally \r\nthe produce severe left and moderate right \r\n  \r\nAt L5-S1, there is elongation of the spinal canal due to the \r\nsubluxation of L5 \r\non S1.  There are prominent facet osteophytes bilaterally.  The \r\ncombination of \r\nthese factors and loss of height of the intervertebral disc as \r\nwell as disc \r\nbulging produces moderate -severe narrowing of the neural \r\nforamina \r\nbilaterally. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIMPRESSION: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n1. As discussed above, the vertebral, intervertebral disc, facet \r\nand left \r\npsoas muscle findings are likely due to a combination of \r\nscoliosis and chronic \r\ndegenerative disc disease, likely with inflammation on this \r\nbasis. \r\n2. The minimal change over time, vacuum phenomenon in the \r\nintervertebral discs \r\nand facet joints, absence of bone destruction and pattern of \r\nsignal intensity \r\nabnormalities argue against infection as the etiology. \r\n3. Degenerative disc disease produces mild encroachment on \r\nseveral nerve roots \r\nand more severe narrowing of the neural foramina at several \r\nlevels. \r\n\r\nEXAMINATION:  TIB/FIB (AP AND LAT) LEFT \r\n  \r\nINDICATION:  ___ year old woman with LLE edema, phlebolith seen \r\non US  // \r\nphlebolith seen on US? \r\n  \r\nTECHNIQUE:  Left tibia, fibula two views \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  Ultrasound lower extremity ___ \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nLeft knee arthroplasty.

She is\r\ncurrently on C2D12 of treatment with decitabine and presents \r\nwith\r\none day of confusion and chills. Neutropenic and afebrile with \r\nno infectious source identified, improved rapidly to baseline on \r\n___ and IV antibiotics were deescalated. \r\n\r\n#Altered mental status: Presented with word finding difficulty \r\nand generalized malaise with decreased PO intake, without true \r\nglobal sensorium deficit. 1 month prior during hospitalization \r\nhad been diagnosed with presumed osteomyelitis though imaging \r\nwas equivocal, and started on 1 month broad spectrum ABX course. \r\nOn this admission, ___ c/f meningitis, cefepime was increased to \r\nmeningitis dosing and ampicillin was added. Her home vanc and \r\nmica were continued. On ___ ___ the patient rapidly improved and \r\nmental status and symptoms were back to her baseline. Urine \r\nculture drawn in the ED (taken in bed-pan, not sterile) grew \r\nEnteroccus faecium pan-resistant, including ampicillin and \r\nvancomycin. The organism was not sensitive to any of the \r\nantibiotics that she was on, thus the organism was not treated, \r\nhowever she improved to baseline as above. Thus the UTI was \r\nlikely not the source of her AMS. In this light, she was not \r\nsent out on further antibiotics, but was counseled to return to \r\nthe hospital if she developed urinary symptoms or more \r\nconfusion. The true etiology is unclear. It may have been a \r\nviral infection or possibly cerebral hypoperfusion in the \r\nsetting of vascular pathology (h/o aneurysms). \r\n\r\n#UTI: see above for urine culture growing Enterococcus faecium. \r\n\r\n#LLE edema: Had a history of DVTs and was previously on \r\nrivaroxaban but this had been held for some time ___ \r\nthrombocytopenia.

Evaluate for hemorrhage. \r\n  \r\nTECHNIQUE:  Sagittal and axial T1 weighted imaging were \r\nperformed. After \r\nadministration of 11 mL of Gadavist intravenous contrast, axial \r\nimaging was \r\nperformed with gradient echo, FLAIR, diffusion, and T1 \r\ntechnique. Sagittal \r\nMPRAGE imaging was performed and re-formatted in axial and \r\ncoronal \r\norientations. \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  CT head ___ \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nThere is no evidence of acute infarction, or intracranial \r\nhemorrhage.  The \r\nventricles are normal in size without mass effect or midline \r\nshift.  There is \r\nno abnormal enhancement, enhancing mass, or leptomeningeal \r\ndisease.  There is \r\nminimal nonspecific scattered foci of hyperintense T2/FLAIR \r\nsignal changes \r\nwithin the subcortical and periventricular white matter, which \r\nis likely a \r\nsequela of chronic small vessel microangiopathy.

This was followed by sagittal and \r\naxial T1 \r\nimages obtained after the uneventful intravenous administration \r\nof 11 mL of \r\nGadavist  contrast agent. \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  Lumbar spine MR examinations ___ and ___.  \r\nCT abdomen and pelvis ___. \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nAgain seen is scoliosis convex to the left in the upper lumbar \r\nspine and to \r\nthe right in the lower lumbar spine.  Again seen is anterior \r\nsubluxation of L5 \r\non S1.  Again seen is ___ type 1 signal intensity change at \r\nL2-3.  This \r\nincludes a low signal of the vertebral endplates on the T1 \r\nweighted images and \r\nhigh signal of these endplates on the STIR images.  This finding \r\nhas not \r\nchanged since ___. \r\n  \r\nNew since ___ but unchanged since ___ are \r\nsimilar changes \r\nat the L4-5 interspace.  There is low signal of the endplates on \r\nthe T1 \r\nweighted images and high signal on the STIR images.  All of the \r\nlumbar discs \r\nare hypointense on the T2 weighted and STIR images as are the \r\ndiscs at the T9 \r\nthrough T12 level.  These are further manifestations of \r\ndegenerative disc \r\ndisease.  The endplates at L2-3 and at L4-5 enhance after \r\ncontrast \r\nadministration.  This is typical ___ type 1 change.  The \r\nintervertebral \r\ndiscs themselves do not enhance after contrast administration. \r\n  \r\nAgain seen are hypointensities in the intervertebral discs at \r\nmultiple levels. \r\nCorrelation with the CT abdomen and pelvis of ___ \r\ndemonstrates \r\nthat at every level from L2 through S1 included a vacuum \r\nphenomenon in the \r\nintervertebral disc. \r\n  \r\nThere is no evidence of abnormal intraspinal \r\ncontrast-enhancement. \r\n  \r\nThe psoas and spinal erector muscles are asymmetric and \r\ndemonstrate fatty \r\natrophy bilaterally. These changes are likely a result of the \r\nscoliosis.  Much \r\nof the hyperintensity seen on the pre and postcontrast axial T1 \r\nweighted \r\nimages through the medial portion of the left psoas muscle at \r\nthe lower L4 \r\nlevel is due to the fatty atrophy, rather than enhancement.  It \r\nis unclear \r\nwhether there is any abnormal enhancement of the left psoas \r\nmuscle, if so, it \r\nis minimal. \r\n  \r\nHypointensity on the T1 weighted images with enhancement after \r\ncontrast \r\nadministration involves the left side of the superior portion of \r\nthe L5 \r\nvertebral body and extends through the pedicle into the facet \r\njoint.  This \r\ncorrelates with mild hyperintensity in these regions on the STIR \r\nimages.  \r\nThere is slight induration of the adjacent fat between the \r\nvertebral body and \r\nthe psoas muscle, best seen on image 30 of series 7 with \r\nenhancement seen on \r\nimage 30 of series 9.  These findings may represent further \r\ninflammatory \r\nchange due to degenerative disease, or a local focus of \r\ninfection.  Note that \r\nthis appearance is quite similar to that of the ___ \r\nstudy.  The CT \r\nscans through the left facet joint at this level consistently \r\ndemonstrated a \r\nvacuum phenomenon, arguing strongly against infection of the \r\njoint.  There is \r\nno evidence of bone destruction on the CT scans, which would be \r\nhighly unusual \r\nif there were chronic osteomyelitis extending as far back as \r\n___.  \r\nThere is similar mild enhancement posteriorly along the left \r\nlamina at this \r\nlevel.  Overall, these findings again are more likely due to \r\ninflammatory \r\ndegenerative disease than infection. \r\n  \r\nThe combination of vacuum phenomenon, low signal of the disc on \r\nthe T2 \r\nweighted images, ___ type 1 signal intensity changes of the \r\nendplates and \r\nstability over time all argue in favor of degenerative disc \r\ndisease as the \r\ncause of these changes.  This constellation of findings would be \r\nextremely \r\nunlikely in the setting of discitis. \r\n  \r\nThere is a mild bulge of the T11-12 disc with no encroachment on \r\nthe spinal \r\ncord or neural foramina. \r\n  \r\nAt T12-L1 there is no encroachment on the cord or foramina.  \r\nIncidentally \r\nnoted is an apparent right renal cyst, better evaluated on the \r\nrecent CT scan. \r\nThere is a small midline and right-sided protrusion of the \r\nintervertebral disc \r\nthat extends superiorly along the posterior margin of the L1 \r\nvertebral body.  \r\nThis does not contact the nerve roots.  The neural foramina \r\nappear normal. \r\n  \r\nAt L1-2 there is a small midline and right-sided disc protrusion \r\nthat \r\nencroaches on the thecal sac but does not contact the nerve \r\nroots.  This \r\nfragment extends superiorly along the posterior margin of the L1 \r\nbody.  The \r\nneural foramina appear normal. \r\n  \r\nAt L2-3, bulging of the disc and facet osteophytes produce \r\nencroachment on the \r\ntraversing L3 nerve roots bilaterally.  There is narrowing of \r\nthe right neural \r\nforamen due to facet osteophytes and intervertebral osteophytes. \r\n\r\n  \r\nAt L3-4, disc bulging and intervertebral osteophytes contact the \r\ntraversing \r\nright L4 nerve root.  The neural foramina are moderately \r\nnarrowed bilaterally. \r\n  \r\nAt L4-5, there is disc bulging but no evidence of nerve root \r\ncompression \r\nwithin the spinal canal.  There are prominent facet osteophytes \r\nbilaterally \r\nthe produce severe left and moderate right \r\n  \r\nAt L5-S1, there is elongation of the spinal canal due to the \r\nsubluxation of L5 \r\non S1.  There are prominent facet osteophytes bilaterally.  The \r\ncombination of \r\nthese factors and loss of height of the intervertebral disc as \r\nwell as disc \r\nbulging produces moderate -severe narrowing of the neural \r\nforamina \r\nbilaterally. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIMPRESSION: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n1. As discussed above, the vertebral, intervertebral disc, facet \r\nand left \r\npsoas muscle findings are likely due to a combination of \r\nscoliosis and chronic \r\ndegenerative disc disease, likely with inflammation on this \r\nbasis. \r\n2. The minimal change over time, vacuum phenomenon in the \r\nintervertebral discs \r\nand facet joints, absence of bone destruction and pattern of \r\nsignal intensity \r\nabnormalities argue against infection as the etiology. \r\n3. Degenerative disc disease produces mild encroachment on \r\nseveral nerve roots \r\nand more severe narrowing of the neural foramina at several \r\nlevels. \r\n\r\nEXAMINATION:  TIB/FIB (AP AND LAT) LEFT \r\n  \r\nINDICATION:  ___ year old woman with LLE edema, phlebolith seen \r\non US  // \r\nphlebolith seen on US? \r\n  \r\nTECHNIQUE:  Left tibia, fibula two views \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  Ultrasound lower extremity ___ \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nLeft knee arthroplasty.

Neutropenic and afebrile with \r\nno infectious source identified, improved rapidly to baseline on \r\n___ and IV antibiotics were deescalated. \r\n\r\n#Altered mental status: Presented with word finding difficulty \r\nand generalized malaise with decreased PO intake, without true \r\nglobal sensorium deficit. 1 month prior during hospitalization \r\nhad been diagnosed with presumed osteomyelitis though imaging \r\nwas equivocal, and started on 1 month broad spectrum ABX course. \r\nOn this admission, ___ c/f meningitis, cefepime was increased to \r\nmeningitis dosing and ampicillin was added. Her home vanc and \r\nmica were continued. On ___ ___ the patient rapidly improved and \r\nmental status and symptoms were back to her baseline. Urine \r\nculture drawn in the ED (taken in bed-pan, not sterile) grew \r\nEnteroccus faecium pan-resistant, including ampicillin and \r\nvancomycin. The organism was not sensitive to any of the \r\nantibiotics that she was on, thus the organism was not treated, \r\nhowever she improved to baseline as above. Thus the UTI was \r\nlikely not the source of her AMS. In this light, she was not \r\nsent out on further antibiotics, but was counseled to return to \r\nthe hospital if she developed urinary symptoms or more \r\nconfusion. The true etiology is unclear. It may have been a \r\nviral infection or possibly cerebral hypoperfusion in the \r\nsetting of vascular pathology (h/o aneurysms). \r\n\r\n#UTI: see above for urine culture growing Enterococcus faecium. \r\n\r\n#LLE edema: Had a history of DVTs and was previously on \r\nrivaroxaban but this had been held for some time ___ \r\nthrombocytopenia.

Evaluate for hemorrhage. \r\n  \r\nTECHNIQUE:  Sagittal and axial T1 weighted imaging were \r\nperformed. After \r\nadministration of 11 mL of Gadavist intravenous contrast, axial \r\nimaging was \r\nperformed with gradient echo, FLAIR, diffusion, and T1 \r\ntechnique. Sagittal \r\nMPRAGE imaging was performed and re-formatted in axial and \r\ncoronal \r\norientations. \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  CT head ___ \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nThere is no evidence of acute infarction, or intracranial \r\nhemorrhage.  The \r\nventricles are normal in size without mass effect or midline \r\nshift.  There is \r\nno abnormal enhancement, enhancing mass, or leptomeningeal \r\ndisease.  There is \r\nminimal nonspecific scattered foci of hyperintense T2/FLAIR \r\nsignal changes \r\nwithin the subcortical and periventricular white matter, which \r\nis likely a \r\nsequela of chronic small vessel microangiopathy.  The dural \r\nvenous sinuses \r\nappear patent on post-contrast MPRAGE images.  The paranasal \r\nsinuses appear \r\nclear.  The bilateral mastoid air cells appear unremarkable.  \r\nThe orbits and \r\nvisualized soft tissues appear unremarkable. \r\n  \r\nIMPRESSION: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n1.

This was followed by sagittal and \r\naxial T1 \r\nimages obtained after the uneventful intravenous administration \r\nof 11 mL of \r\nGadavist  contrast agent. \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  Lumbar spine MR examinations ___ and ___.  \r\nCT abdomen and pelvis ___. \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nAgain seen is scoliosis convex to the left in the upper lumbar \r\nspine and to \r\nthe right in the lower lumbar spine.  Again seen is anterior \r\nsubluxation of L5 \r\non S1.  Again seen is ___ type 1 signal intensity change at \r\nL2-3.  This \r\nincludes a low signal of the vertebral endplates on the T1 \r\nweighted images and \r\nhigh signal of these endplates on the STIR images.  This finding \r\nhas not \r\nchanged since ___. \r\n  \r\nNew since ___ but unchanged since ___ are \r\nsimilar changes \r\nat the L4-5 interspace.  There is low signal of the endplates on \r\nthe T1 \r\nweighted images and high signal on the STIR images.  All of the \r\nlumbar discs \r\nare hypointense on the T2 weighted and STIR images as are the \r\ndiscs at the T9 \r\nthrough T12 level.  These are further manifestations of \r\ndegenerative disc \r\ndisease.  The endplates at L2-3 and at L4-5 enhance after \r\ncontrast \r\nadministration.  This is typical ___ type 1 change.  The \r\nintervertebral \r\ndiscs themselves do not enhance after contrast administration. \r\n  \r\nAgain seen are hypointensities in the intervertebral discs at \r\nmultiple levels. \r\nCorrelation with the CT abdomen and pelvis of ___ \r\ndemonstrates \r\nthat at every level from L2 through S1 included a vacuum \r\nphenomenon in the \r\nintervertebral disc. \r\n  \r\nThere is no evidence of abnormal intraspinal \r\ncontrast-enhancement. \r\n  \r\nThe psoas and spinal erector muscles are asymmetric and \r\ndemonstrate fatty \r\natrophy bilaterally. These changes are likely a result of the \r\nscoliosis.  Much \r\nof the hyperintensity seen on the pre and postcontrast axial T1 \r\nweighted \r\nimages through the medial portion of the left psoas muscle at \r\nthe lower L4 \r\nlevel is due to the fatty atrophy, rather than enhancement.  It \r\nis unclear \r\nwhether there is any abnormal enhancement of the left psoas \r\nmuscle, if so, it \r\nis minimal. \r\n  \r\nHypointensity on the T1 weighted images with enhancement after \r\ncontrast \r\nadministration involves the left side of the superior portion of \r\nthe L5 \r\nvertebral body and extends through the pedicle into the facet \r\njoint.  This \r\ncorrelates with mild hyperintensity in these regions on the STIR \r\nimages.  \r\nThere is slight induration of the adjacent fat between the \r\nvertebral body and \r\nthe psoas muscle, best seen on image 30 of series 7 with \r\nenhancement seen on \r\nimage 30 of series 9.  These findings may represent further \r\ninflammatory \r\nchange due to degenerative disease, or a local focus of \r\ninfection.  Note that \r\nthis appearance is quite similar to that of the ___ \r\nstudy.  The CT \r\nscans through the left facet joint at this level consistently \r\ndemonstrated a \r\nvacuum phenomenon, arguing strongly against infection of the \r\njoint.  There is \r\nno evidence of bone destruction on the CT scans, which would be \r\nhighly unusual \r\nif there were chronic osteomyelitis extending as far back as \r\n___.  \r\nThere is similar mild enhancement posteriorly along the left \r\nlamina at this \r\nlevel.  Overall, these findings again are more likely due to \r\ninflammatory \r\ndegenerative disease than infection. \r\n  \r\nThe combination of vacuum phenomenon, low signal of the disc on \r\nthe T2 \r\nweighted images, ___ type 1 signal intensity changes of the \r\nendplates and \r\nstability over time all argue in favor of degenerative disc \r\ndisease as the \r\ncause of these changes.  This constellation of findings would be \r\nextremely \r\nunlikely in the setting of discitis. \r\n  \r\nThere is a mild bulge of the T11-12 disc with no encroachment on \r\nthe spinal \r\ncord or neural foramina. \r\n  \r\nAt T12-L1 there is no encroachment on the cord or foramina.  \r\nIncidentally \r\nnoted is an apparent right renal cyst, better evaluated on the \r\nrecent CT scan. \r\nThere is a small midline and right-sided protrusion of the \r\nintervertebral disc \r\nthat extends superiorly along the posterior margin of the L1 \r\nvertebral body.  \r\nThis does not contact the nerve roots.  The neural foramina \r\nappear normal. \r\n  \r\nAt L1-2 there is a small midline and right-sided disc protrusion \r\nthat \r\nencroaches on the thecal sac but does not contact the nerve \r\nroots.  This \r\nfragment extends superiorly along the posterior margin of the L1 \r\nbody.  The \r\nneural foramina appear normal. \r\n  \r\nAt L2-3, bulging of the disc and facet osteophytes produce \r\nencroachment on the \r\ntraversing L3 nerve roots bilaterally.  There is narrowing of \r\nthe right neural \r\nforamen due to facet osteophytes and intervertebral osteophytes. \r\n\r\n  \r\nAt L3-4, disc bulging and intervertebral osteophytes contact the \r\ntraversing \r\nright L4 nerve root.  The neural foramina are moderately \r\nnarrowed bilaterally. \r\n  \r\nAt L4-5, there is disc bulging but no evidence of nerve root \r\ncompression \r\nwithin the spinal canal.  There are prominent facet osteophytes \r\nbilaterally \r\nthe produce severe left and moderate right \r\n  \r\nAt L5-S1, there is elongation of the spinal canal due to the \r\nsubluxation of L5 \r\non S1.  There are prominent facet osteophytes bilaterally.  The \r\ncombination of \r\nthese factors and loss of height of the intervertebral disc as \r\nwell as disc \r\nbulging produces moderate -severe narrowing of the neural \r\nforamina \r\nbilaterally. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIMPRESSION: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n1. As discussed above, the vertebral, intervertebral disc, facet \r\nand left \r\npsoas muscle findings are likely due to a combination of \r\nscoliosis and chronic \r\ndegenerative disc disease, likely with inflammation on this \r\nbasis. \r\n2. The minimal change over time, vacuum phenomenon in the \r\nintervertebral discs \r\nand facet joints, absence of bone destruction and pattern of \r\nsignal intensity \r\nabnormalities argue against infection as the etiology. \r\n3. Degenerative disc disease produces mild encroachment on \r\nseveral nerve roots \r\nand more severe narrowing of the neural foramina at several \r\nlevels. \r\n\r\nEXAMINATION:  TIB/FIB (AP AND LAT) LEFT \r\n  \r\nINDICATION:  ___ year old woman with LLE edema, phlebolith seen \r\non US  // \r\nphlebolith seen on US? \r\n  \r\nTECHNIQUE:  Left tibia, fibula two views \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  Ultrasound lower extremity ___ \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nLeft knee arthroplasty.

She is\r\ncurrently on C2D12 of treatment with decitabine and presents \r\nwith\r\none day of confusion and chills. Neutropenic and afebrile with \r\nno infectious source identified, improved rapidly to baseline on \r\n___ and IV antibiotics were deescalated. \r\n\r\n#Altered mental status: Presented with word finding difficulty \r\nand generalized malaise with decreased PO intake, without true \r\nglobal sensorium deficit. 1 month prior during hospitalization \r\nhad been diagnosed with presumed osteomyelitis though imaging \r\nwas equivocal, and started on 1 month broad spectrum ABX course. \r\nOn this admission, ___ c/f meningitis, cefepime was increased to \r\nmeningitis dosing and ampicillin was added. Her home vanc and \r\nmica were continued. On ___ ___ the patient rapidly improved and \r\nmental status and symptoms were back to her baseline. Urine \r\nculture drawn in the ED (taken in bed-pan, not sterile) grew \r\nEnteroccus faecium pan-resistant, including ampicillin and \r\nvancomycin. The organism was not sensitive to any of the \r\nantibiotics that she was on, thus the organism was not treated, \r\nhowever she improved to baseline as above. Thus the UTI was \r\nlikely not the source of her AMS. In this light, she was not \r\nsent out on further antibiotics, but was counseled to return to \r\nthe hospital if she developed urinary symptoms or more \r\nconfusion. The true etiology is unclear. It may have been a \r\nviral infection or possibly cerebral hypoperfusion in the \r\nsetting of vascular pathology (h/o aneurysms). \r\n\r\n#UTI: see above for urine culture growing Enterococcus faecium. \r\n\r\n#LLE edema: Had a history of DVTs and was previously on \r\nrivaroxaban but this had been held for some time ___ \r\nthrombocytopenia.

Held on discharge. \r\n\r\n#?Nocardia skin rash: Had area of tenderness at site chronic \r\nvenous stasis dermatitis, previously biopsied by not sent for \r\nAFB/nocardia.

Evaluate for hemorrhage. \r\n  \r\nTECHNIQUE:  Sagittal and axial T1 weighted imaging were \r\nperformed. After \r\nadministration of 11 mL of Gadavist intravenous contrast, axial \r\nimaging was \r\nperformed with gradient echo, FLAIR, diffusion, and T1 \r\ntechnique. Sagittal \r\nMPRAGE imaging was performed and re-formatted in axial and \r\ncoronal \r\norientations. \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  CT head ___ \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nThere is no evidence of acute infarction, or intracranial \r\nhemorrhage.  The \r\nventricles are normal in size without mass effect or midline \r\nshift.  There is \r\nno abnormal enhancement, enhancing mass, or leptomeningeal \r\ndisease.  There is \r\nminimal nonspecific scattered foci of hyperintense T2/FLAIR \r\nsignal changes \r\nwithin the subcortical and periventricular white matter, which \r\nis likely a \r\nsequela of chronic small vessel microangiopathy.

This was followed by sagittal and \r\naxial T1 \r\nimages obtained after the uneventful intravenous administration \r\nof 11 mL of \r\nGadavist  contrast agent. \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  Lumbar spine MR examinations ___ and ___.  \r\nCT abdomen and pelvis ___. \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nAgain seen is scoliosis convex to the left in the upper lumbar \r\nspine and to \r\nthe right in the lower lumbar spine.  Again seen is anterior \r\nsubluxation of L5 \r\non S1.  Again seen is ___ type 1 signal intensity change at \r\nL2-3.  This \r\nincludes a low signal of the vertebral endplates on the T1 \r\nweighted images and \r\nhigh signal of these endplates on the STIR images.  This finding \r\nhas not \r\nchanged since ___. \r\n  \r\nNew since ___ but unchanged since ___ are \r\nsimilar changes \r\nat the L4-5 interspace.  There is low signal of the endplates on \r\nthe T1 \r\nweighted images and high signal on the STIR images.  All of the \r\nlumbar discs \r\nare hypointense on the T2 weighted and STIR images as are the \r\ndiscs at the T9 \r\nthrough T12 level.  These are further manifestations of \r\ndegenerative disc \r\ndisease.  The endplates at L2-3 and at L4-5 enhance after \r\ncontrast \r\nadministration.  This is typical ___ type 1 change.  The \r\nintervertebral \r\ndiscs themselves do not enhance after contrast administration. \r\n  \r\nAgain seen are hypointensities in the intervertebral discs at \r\nmultiple levels. \r\nCorrelation with the CT abdomen and pelvis of ___ \r\ndemonstrates \r\nthat at every level from L2 through S1 included a vacuum \r\nphenomenon in the \r\nintervertebral disc. \r\n  \r\nThere is no evidence of abnormal intraspinal \r\ncontrast-enhancement. \r\n  \r\nThe psoas and spinal erector muscles are asymmetric and \r\ndemonstrate fatty \r\natrophy bilaterally. These changes are likely a result of the \r\nscoliosis.  Much \r\nof the hyperintensity seen on the pre and postcontrast axial T1 \r\nweighted \r\nimages through the medial portion of the left psoas muscle at \r\nthe lower L4 \r\nlevel is due to the fatty atrophy, rather than enhancement.  It \r\nis unclear \r\nwhether there is any abnormal enhancement of the left psoas \r\nmuscle, if so, it \r\nis minimal. \r\n  \r\nHypointensity on the T1 weighted images with enhancement after \r\ncontrast \r\nadministration involves the left side of the superior portion of \r\nthe L5 \r\nvertebral body and extends through the pedicle into the facet \r\njoint.  This \r\ncorrelates with mild hyperintensity in these regions on the STIR \r\nimages.  \r\nThere is slight induration of the adjacent fat between the \r\nvertebral body and \r\nthe psoas muscle, best seen on image 30 of series 7 with \r\nenhancement seen on \r\nimage 30 of series 9.  These findings may represent further \r\ninflammatory \r\nchange due to degenerative disease, or a local focus of \r\ninfection.  Note that \r\nthis appearance is quite similar to that of the ___ \r\nstudy.  The CT \r\nscans through the left facet joint at this level consistently \r\ndemonstrated a \r\nvacuum phenomenon, arguing strongly against infection of the \r\njoint.  There is \r\nno evidence of bone destruction on the CT scans, which would be \r\nhighly unusual \r\nif there were chronic osteomyelitis extending as far back as \r\n___.  \r\nThere is similar mild enhancement posteriorly along the left \r\nlamina at this \r\nlevel.  Overall, these findings again are more likely due to \r\ninflammatory \r\ndegenerative disease than infection. \r\n  \r\nThe combination of vacuum phenomenon, low signal of the disc on \r\nthe T2 \r\nweighted images, ___ type 1 signal intensity changes of the \r\nendplates and \r\nstability over time all argue in favor of degenerative disc \r\ndisease as the \r\ncause of these changes.  This constellation of findings would be \r\nextremely \r\nunlikely in the setting of discitis. \r\n  \r\nThere is a mild bulge of the T11-12 disc with no encroachment on \r\nthe spinal \r\ncord or neural foramina. \r\n  \r\nAt T12-L1 there is no encroachment on the cord or foramina.  \r\nIncidentally \r\nnoted is an apparent right renal cyst, better evaluated on the \r\nrecent CT scan. \r\nThere is a small midline and right-sided protrusion of the \r\nintervertebral disc \r\nthat extends superiorly along the posterior margin of the L1 \r\nvertebral body.  \r\nThis does not contact the nerve roots.  The neural foramina \r\nappear normal. \r\n  \r\nAt L1-2 there is a small midline and right-sided disc protrusion \r\nthat \r\nencroaches on the thecal sac but does not contact the nerve \r\nroots.  This \r\nfragment extends superiorly along the posterior margin of the L1 \r\nbody.  The \r\nneural foramina appear normal. \r\n  \r\nAt L2-3, bulging of the disc and facet osteophytes produce \r\nencroachment on the \r\ntraversing L3 nerve roots bilaterally.  There is narrowing of \r\nthe right neural \r\nforamen due to facet osteophytes and intervertebral osteophytes. \r\n\r\n  \r\nAt L3-4, disc bulging and intervertebral osteophytes contact the \r\ntraversing \r\nright L4 nerve root.  The neural foramina are moderately \r\nnarrowed bilaterally. \r\n  \r\nAt L4-5, there is disc bulging but no evidence of nerve root \r\ncompression \r\nwithin the spinal canal.  There are prominent facet osteophytes \r\nbilaterally \r\nthe produce severe left and moderate right \r\n  \r\nAt L5-S1, there is elongation of the spinal canal due to the \r\nsubluxation of L5 \r\non S1.  There are prominent facet osteophytes bilaterally.  The \r\ncombination of \r\nthese factors and loss of height of the intervertebral disc as \r\nwell as disc \r\nbulging produces moderate -severe narrowing of the neural \r\nforamina \r\nbilaterally. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIMPRESSION: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n1. As discussed above, the vertebral, intervertebral disc, facet \r\nand left \r\npsoas muscle findings are likely due to a combination of \r\nscoliosis and chronic \r\ndegenerative disc disease, likely with inflammation on this \r\nbasis. \r\n2. The minimal change over time, vacuum phenomenon in the \r\nintervertebral discs \r\nand facet joints, absence of bone destruction and pattern of \r\nsignal intensity \r\nabnormalities argue against infection as the etiology. \r\n3. Degenerative disc disease produces mild encroachment on \r\nseveral nerve roots \r\nand more severe narrowing of the neural foramina at several \r\nlevels. \r\n\r\nEXAMINATION:  TIB/FIB (AP AND LAT) LEFT \r\n  \r\nINDICATION:  ___ year old woman with LLE edema, phlebolith seen \r\non US  // \r\nphlebolith seen on US? \r\n  \r\nTECHNIQUE:  Left tibia, fibula two views \r\n  \r\nCOMPARISON:  Ultrasound lower extremity ___ \r\n  \r\nFINDINGS:  \r\n  \r\nLeft knee arthroplasty.

She is\r\ncurrently on C2D12 of treatment with decitabine and presents \r\nwith\r\none day of confusion and chills. Neutropenic and afebrile with \r\nno infectious source identified, improved rapidly to baseline on \r\n___ and IV antibiotics were deescalated. \r\n\r\n#Altered mental status: Presented with word finding difficulty \r\nand generalized malaise with decreased PO intake, without true \r\nglobal sensorium deficit. 1 month prior during hospitalization \r\nhad been diagnosed with presumed osteomyelitis though imaging \r\nwas equivocal, and started on 1 month broad spectrum ABX course. \r\nOn this admission, ___ c/f meningitis, cefepime was increased to \r\nmeningitis dosing and ampicillin was added. Her home vanc and \r\nmica were continued. On ___ ___ the patient rapidly improved and \r\nmental status and symptoms were back to her baseline. Urine \r\nculture drawn in the ED (taken in bed-pan, not sterile) grew \r\nEnteroccus faecium pan-resistant, including ampicillin and \r\nvancomycin. The organism was not sensitive to any of the \r\nantibiotics that she was on, thus the organism was not treated, \r\nhowever she improved to baseline as above. Thus the UTI was \r\nlikely not the source of her AMS. In this light, she was not \r\nsent out on further antibiotics, but was counseled to return to \r\nthe hospital if she developed urinary symptoms or more \r\nconfusion. The true etiology is unclear. It may have been a \r\nviral infection or possibly cerebral hypoperfusion in the \r\nsetting of vascular pathology (h/o aneurysms). \r\n\r\n#UTI: see above for urine culture growing Enterococcus faecium. \r\n\r\n#LLE edema: Had a history of DVTs and was previously on \r\nrivaroxaban but this had been held for some time ___ \r\nthrombocytopenia.

No fluid collection in the area of pain in the left lateral \r\ncalf. \r\n\r\n \r\nBrief Hospital Course:\r\nMs. ___ is a ___ immunocompromised female ___ \r\nalloSCT for secondary MDS admitted for acute change in headaches \r\nwith new, severe symptoms such as nausea and vomiting now with \r\nfevers to 103 and coagulase-negative gram-positive cocci in \r\nclusters in blood cultures being treated for S. epidermidis \r\nbacteremia.\r\n\r\n#Headache\r\nCT head performed in the ED ___ was unremarkable but infectious \r\netiology remained very high on the\r\ndifferential given the patient's immunosuppression regimen and \r\nhistory of aseptic meningitis during her last admission. She \r\nalso had history of R internal carotid cavernous sinus aneurysm \r\nwith coiling in the past. An MRI head ___ was unremarkable. CMV, \r\nEBV, HSV, HHV6, adeno, ___, arboviruses, Lyme, \r\ncrypotococcus, and fungal markers were tested and all were \r\nnegative. The patient's headache resolved and she was symptom \r\nfree at time of discharge. \r\n\r\n#S. epidermidis Bacteremia\r\nShe had fevers up to 103 on ___ and was started on vancomycin \r\nand cefepime. The vancomycin was DC'd ___ overnight and she was \r\nstarted on linezolid per ID recommendations as she had a history \r\nof VRE bacteremia in the past and was continued on cefepime. ___ \r\nblood culture bottles grew S. epidermidis and she was narrowed \r\nto vancomycin only. A chest x-ray was unremarkable for \r\npneumonia. A CT chest ___ revealed no evidence of pneumonia. A \r\nCT abdomen pelvis ___ did not show any evidence of infection. An \r\nultrasound of her port site was without evidence of infection. \r\nAn ultrasound of her LLE ordered for concern of an abscess \r\nrevealed a distal DVT but no fluid collections. A TTE revealed \r\nnormal biventricular cavity sizes with mild global left \r\nventricular hypokinesis, mild mitral regurgitation with normal \r\nvalve morphology and trace aortic regurgitation with normal \r\nvalve morphology. A TEE was scheduled but was cancelled as \r\npatient will need 6 weeks of therapy for treatment of possible \r\nseptic thrombophlebitis. She was continued on Vancomycin until \r\n___ and was transitioned to Daptomycin on ___ as her \r\nVancomycin level fluctuated frequently throughout her \r\nhospitalization, making dosing of the medication challenging. \r\nShe will need to remain on Daptomycin until ___ to complete 6 \r\nweeks of antibiotic therapy.\r\n\r\n#Mechanical Fall\r\nPatient had a mechanical fall during the evening of ___. She \r\nbecame incontinent of urine and slipped and fell while trying to \r\nmake it to the bathroom. CT head and C spine were unremarkable. \r\nX rays of her left wrist revealed no fractures. She was given a \r\nhard brace based on an OT evaluation. Ecchymosis on head was \r\nimproving at discharge. She will continue to wear the brace \r\nuntil symptoms improve.\r\n\r\n#MDS ___ Allo MUD SCT\r\nShe was conditioned with Flu/Bu/ATG RI and was on cyclosporine \r\nfor immunosuppression. Her home cyclosporine dosage was 75mg QAM \r\nand 50mg QPM. Initial cyclosporine levels were low and her \r\ndosage was increased to 100mg BID. Her creatinine increased on \r\nthis dose and she was discharged on dosage of 75mg BID. Her home \r\nprophylaxis with fluconazole, Bactrim, and valganciclovir was \r\ninitially continued. However, given worsening neutropenia, her \r\nBactrim was transitioned to atovaquone and her valganciclovir \r\nwas transitioned to acyclovir. She was scheduled to have a bone \r\nmarrow biopsy with ___ as an outpatient on ___ but this was \r\ncancelled due to patient's new DVT. She will need to have a bone \r\nmarrow biopsy done as an outpatient.\r\n\r\n#DVT\r\nEnoxaparin was held ___ for possible LP but a US LLE \r\nperformed due to the concern of an abscess revealed a new distal \r\nDVT on ___ in LLE. LP was deferred due to resolution of her \r\nheadache and lack of neurologic symptoms and she was put on a \r\ntherapeutic dose of Enoxaparin. Her lower extremity swelling \r\nimproved and she was discharged on Enoxaparin 80mg BID.\r\n\r\n___\r\nShe presented with Cr above baseline at 1.7 No casts were \r\nvisualized on UA and she had a FENa of 1.7% on ___, indicating \r\nprerenal etiology. She was given fluids and her creatinine \r\nreturned to baseline. Her Cr increased again on ___ to 1.4. She \r\nwas again given IVF and her cyclosporine was decreased from \r\n100mg BID to 75mg BID. Cr at discharge improved to 1.2.\r\n\r\n#Asthma\r\nAlbuterol and duonebs were given as needed\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\r\n===================\r\n[] Follow up with Dr. ___ on ___\r\n[] Continue daptomycin and Vancomycin/heparin locks until ___.\r\n[] Will need to get weekly CK levels while on daptomycin.\r\n[] Repeat bone marrow biopsy scheduled for ___ was cancelled \r\ngiven new DVT and infection.

She \r\nalso had history of R internal carotid cavernous sinus aneurysm \r\nwith coiling in the past. An MRI head ___ was unremarkable. CMV, \r\nEBV, HSV, HHV6, adeno, ___, arboviruses, Lyme, \r\ncrypotococcus, and fungal markers were tested and all were \r\nnegative. The patient's headache resolved and she was symptom \r\nfree at time of discharge. \r\n\r\n#S. epidermidis Bacteremia\r\nShe had fevers up to 103 on ___ and was started on vancomycin \r\nand cefepime. The vancomycin was DC'd ___ overnight and she was \r\nstarted on linezolid per ID recommendations as she had a history \r\nof VRE bacteremia in the past and was continued on cefepime. ___ \r\nblood culture bottles grew S. epidermidis and she was narrowed \r\nto vancomycin only. A chest x-ray was unremarkable for \r\npneumonia. A CT chest ___ revealed no evidence of pneumonia. A \r\nCT abdomen pelvis ___ did not show any evidence of infection. An \r\nultrasound of her port site was without evidence of infection. \r\nAn ultrasound of her LLE ordered for concern of an abscess \r\nrevealed a distal DVT but no fluid collections. A TTE revealed \r\nnormal biventricular cavity sizes with mild global left \r\nventricular hypokinesis, mild mitral regurgitation with normal \r\nvalve morphology and trace aortic regurgitation with normal \r\nvalve morphology. A TEE was scheduled but was cancelled as \r\npatient will need 6 weeks of therapy for treatment of possible \r\nseptic thrombophlebitis. She was continued on Vancomycin until \r\n___ and was transitioned to Daptomycin on ___ as her \r\nVancomycin level fluctuated frequently throughout her \r\nhospitalization, making dosing of the medication challenging. \r\nShe will need to remain on Daptomycin until ___ to complete 6 \r\nweeks of antibiotic therapy.\r\n\r\n#Mechanical Fall\r\nPatient had a mechanical fall during the evening of ___.

She \r\nalso had history of R internal carotid cavernous sinus aneurysm \r\nwith coiling in the past. An MRI head ___ was unremarkable. CMV, \r\nEBV, HSV, HHV6, adeno, ___, arboviruses, Lyme, \r\ncrypotococcus, and fungal markers were tested and all were \r\nnegative. The patient's headache resolved and she was symptom \r\nfree at time of discharge. \r\n\r\n#S. epidermidis Bacteremia\r\nShe had fevers up to 103 on ___ and was started on vancomycin \r\nand cefepime. The vancomycin was DC'd ___ overnight and she was \r\nstarted on linezolid per ID recommendations as she had a history \r\nof VRE bacteremia in the past and was continued on cefepime. ___ \r\nblood culture bottles grew S. epidermidis and she was narrowed \r\nto vancomycin only. A chest x-ray was unremarkable for \r\npneumonia. A CT chest ___ revealed no evidence of pneumonia. A \r\nCT abdomen pelvis ___ did not show any evidence of infection. An \r\nultrasound of her port site was without evidence of infection. \r\nAn ultrasound of her LLE ordered for concern of an abscess \r\nrevealed a distal DVT but no fluid collections. A TTE revealed \r\nnormal biventricular cavity sizes with mild global left \r\nventricular hypokinesis, mild mitral regurgitation with normal \r\nvalve morphology and trace aortic regurgitation with normal \r\nvalve morphology. A TEE was scheduled but was cancelled as \r\npatient will need 6 weeks of therapy for treatment of possible \r\nseptic thrombophlebitis. She was continued on Vancomycin until \r\n___ and was transitioned to Daptomycin on ___ as her \r\nVancomycin level fluctuated frequently throughout her \r\nhospitalization, making dosing of the medication challenging. \r\nShe will need to remain on Daptomycin until ___ to complete 6 \r\nweeks of antibiotic therapy.\r\n\r\n#Mechanical Fall\r\nPatient had a mechanical fall during the evening of ___.

Her creatinine increased on \r\nthis dose and she was discharged on dosage of 75mg BID. Her home \r\nprophylaxis with fluconazole, Bactrim, and valganciclovir was \r\ninitially continued. However, given worsening neutropenia, her \r\nBactrim was transitioned to atovaquone and her valganciclovir \r\nwas transitioned to acyclovir. She was scheduled to have a bone \r\nmarrow biopsy with ___ as an outpatient on ___ but this was \r\ncancelled due to patient's new DVT. She will need to have a bone \r\nmarrow biopsy done as an outpatient.\r\n\r\n#DVT\r\nEnoxaparin was held ___ for possible LP but a US LLE \r\nperformed due to the concern of an abscess revealed a new distal \r\nDVT on ___ in LLE. LP was deferred due to resolution of her \r\nheadache and lack of neurologic symptoms and she was put on a \r\ntherapeutic dose of Enoxaparin. Her lower extremity swelling \r\nimproved and she was discharged on Enoxaparin 80mg BID.\r\n\r\n___\r\nShe presented with Cr above baseline at 1.7 No casts were \r\nvisualized on UA and she had a FENa of 1.7% on ___, indicating \r\nprerenal etiology.

She \r\nalso had history of R internal carotid cavernous sinus aneurysm \r\nwith coiling in the past. An MRI head ___ was unremarkable. CMV, \r\nEBV, HSV, HHV6, adeno, ___, arboviruses, Lyme, \r\ncrypotococcus, and fungal markers were tested and all were \r\nnegative. The patient's headache resolved and she was symptom \r\nfree at time of discharge. \r\n\r\n#S. epidermidis Bacteremia\r\nShe had fevers up to 103 on ___ and was started on vancomycin \r\nand cefepime. The vancomycin was DC'd ___ overnight and she was \r\nstarted on linezolid per ID recommendations as she had a history \r\nof VRE bacteremia in the past and was continued on cefepime. ___ \r\nblood culture bottles grew S. epidermidis and she was narrowed \r\nto vancomycin only. A chest x-ray was unremarkable for \r\npneumonia. A CT chest ___ revealed no evidence of pneumonia. A \r\nCT abdomen pelvis ___ did not show any evidence of infection. An \r\nultrasound of her port site was without evidence of infection. \r\nAn ultrasound of her LLE ordered for concern of an abscess \r\nrevealed a distal DVT but no fluid collections. A TTE revealed \r\nnormal biventricular cavity sizes with mild global left \r\nventricular hypokinesis, mild mitral regurgitation with normal \r\nvalve morphology and trace aortic regurgitation with normal \r\nvalve morphology. A TEE was scheduled but was cancelled as \r\npatient will need 6 weeks of therapy for treatment of possible \r\nseptic thrombophlebitis. She was continued on Vancomycin until \r\n___ and was transitioned to Daptomycin on ___ as her \r\nVancomycin level fluctuated frequently throughout her \r\nhospitalization, making dosing of the medication challenging. \r\nShe will need to remain on Daptomycin until ___ to complete 6 \r\nweeks of antibiotic therapy.\r\n\r\n#Mechanical Fall\r\nPatient had a mechanical fall during the evening of ___.

She \r\nalso had history of R internal carotid cavernous sinus aneurysm \r\nwith coiling in the past. An MRI head ___ was unremarkable. CMV, \r\nEBV, HSV, HHV6, adeno, ___, arboviruses, Lyme, \r\ncrypotococcus, and fungal markers were tested and all were \r\nnegative. The patient's headache resolved and she was symptom \r\nfree at time of discharge. \r\n\r\n#S. epidermidis Bacteremia\r\nShe had fevers up to 103 on ___ and was started on vancomycin \r\nand cefepime. The vancomycin was DC'd ___ overnight and she was \r\nstarted on linezolid per ID recommendations as she had a history \r\nof VRE bacteremia in the past and was continued on cefepime. ___ \r\nblood culture bottles grew S. epidermidis and she was narrowed \r\nto vancomycin only. A chest x-ray was unremarkable for \r\npneumonia. A CT chest ___ revealed no evidence of pneumonia. A \r\nCT abdomen pelvis ___ did not show any evidence of infection. An \r\nultrasound of her port site was without evidence of infection. \r\nAn ultrasound of her LLE ordered for concern of an abscess \r\nrevealed a distal DVT but no fluid collections. A TTE revealed \r\nnormal biventricular cavity sizes with mild global left \r\nventricular hypokinesis, mild mitral regurgitation with normal \r\nvalve morphology and trace aortic regurgitation with normal \r\nvalve morphology. A TEE was scheduled but was cancelled as \r\npatient will need 6 weeks of therapy for treatment of possible \r\nseptic thrombophlebitis. She was continued on Vancomycin until \r\n___ and was transitioned to Daptomycin on ___ as her \r\nVancomycin level fluctuated frequently throughout her \r\nhospitalization, making dosing of the medication challenging. \r\nShe will need to remain on Daptomycin until ___ to complete 6 \r\nweeks of antibiotic therapy.\r\n\r\n#Mechanical Fall\r\nPatient had a mechanical fall during the evening of ___. She \r\nbecame incontinent of urine and slipped and fell while trying to \r\nmake it to the bathroom. CT head and C spine were unremarkable. \r\nX rays of her left wrist revealed no fractures.

She will continue to wear the brace \r\nuntil symptoms improve.\r\n\r\n#MDS ___ Allo MUD SCT\r\nShe was conditioned with Flu/Bu/ATG RI and was on cyclosporine \r\nfor immunosuppression. Her home cyclosporine dosage was 75mg QAM \r\nand 50mg QPM. Initial cyclosporine levels were low and her \r\ndosage was increased to 100mg BID. Her creatinine increased on \r\nthis dose and she was discharged on dosage of 75mg BID. Her home \r\nprophylaxis with fluconazole, Bactrim, and valganciclovir was \r\ninitially continued. However, given worsening neutropenia, her \r\nBactrim was transitioned to atovaquone and her valganciclovir \r\nwas transitioned to acyclovir. She was scheduled to have a bone \r\nmarrow biopsy with ___ as an outpatient on ___ but this was \r\ncancelled due to patient's new DVT. She will need to have a bone \r\nmarrow biopsy done as an outpatient.\r\n\r\n#DVT\r\nEnoxaparin was held ___ for possible LP but a US LLE \r\nperformed due to the concern of an abscess revealed a new distal \r\nDVT on ___ in LLE. LP was deferred due to resolution of her \r\nheadache and lack of neurologic symptoms and she was put on a \r\ntherapeutic dose of Enoxaparin. Her lower extremity swelling \r\nimproved and she was discharged on Enoxaparin 80mg BID.\r\n\r\n___\r\nShe presented with Cr above baseline at 1.7 No casts were \r\nvisualized on UA and she had a FENa of 1.7% on ___, indicating \r\nprerenal etiology. She was given fluids and her creatinine \r\nreturned to baseline. Her Cr increased again on ___ to 1.4. She \r\nwas again given IVF and her cyclosporine was decreased from \r\n100mg BID to 75mg BID. Cr at discharge improved to 1.2.\r\n\r\n#Asthma\r\nAlbuterol and duonebs were given as needed\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\r\n===================\r\n[] Follow up with Dr. ___ on ___\r\n[] Continue daptomycin and Vancomycin/heparin locks until ___.\r\n[] Will need to get weekly CK levels while on daptomycin.\r\n[] Repeat bone marrow biopsy scheduled for ___ was cancelled \r\ngiven new DVT and infection.

It intensified \r\nthroughout\r\nthe day and then in the afternoon she started vomiting numerous\r\ntimes. Which prompted her to go to the ED. She states the\r\nheadache was similar in location to when she gets migraines but\r\nthe duration was different and with migraines she usually gets\r\none episode of nausea in the morning and then it resolves. She\r\ndenies any neck stiffness, rashes, or fevers. She also denies \r\nany\r\nshortness of breath, diarrhea, or dysuria. \r\nShe went to the ED last night and had a head CT done which was \r\nunremarkable. She was then given Tylenol, dexamethasone,\r\nBenadryl, IV fluids, and Compazine. With improvement of her\r\nsymptoms. She then was discharged home early this morning. \r\nHer primary oncology team was concerned about the underlying\r\ncause of her headache given her history of a recent bone marrow\r\ntransplant and that she is on immunosuppression.

She \r\nalso had history of R internal carotid cavernous sinus aneurysm \r\nwith coiling in the past. An MRI head ___ was unremarkable. CMV, \r\nEBV, HSV, HHV6, adeno, ___, arboviruses, Lyme, \r\ncrypotococcus, and fungal markers were tested and all were \r\nnegative. The patient's headache resolved and she was symptom \r\nfree at time of discharge. \r\n\r\n#S. epidermidis Bacteremia\r\nShe had fevers up to 103 on ___ and was started on vancomycin \r\nand cefepime. The vancomycin was DC'd ___ overnight and she was \r\nstarted on linezolid per ID recommendations as she had a history \r\nof VRE bacteremia in the past and was continued on cefepime. ___ \r\nblood culture bottles grew S. epidermidis and she was narrowed \r\nto vancomycin only. A chest x-ray was unremarkable for \r\npneumonia. A CT chest ___ revealed no evidence of pneumonia. A \r\nCT abdomen pelvis ___ did not show any evidence of infection. An \r\nultrasound of her port site was without evidence of infection. \r\nAn ultrasound of her LLE ordered for concern of an abscess \r\nrevealed a distal DVT but no fluid collections. A TTE revealed \r\nnormal biventricular cavity sizes with mild global left \r\nventricular hypokinesis, mild mitral regurgitation with normal \r\nvalve morphology and trace aortic regurgitation with normal \r\nvalve morphology. A TEE was scheduled but was cancelled as \r\npatient will need 6 weeks of therapy for treatment of possible \r\nseptic thrombophlebitis. She was continued on Vancomycin until \r\n___ and was transitioned to Daptomycin on ___ as her \r\nVancomycin level fluctuated frequently throughout her \r\nhospitalization, making dosing of the medication challenging. \r\nShe will need to remain on Daptomycin until ___ to complete 6 \r\nweeks of antibiotic therapy.\r\n\r\n#Mechanical Fall\r\nPatient had a mechanical fall during the evening of ___. She \r\nbecame incontinent of urine and slipped and fell while trying to \r\nmake it to the bathroom. CT head and C spine were unremarkable. \r\nX rays of her left wrist revealed no fractures. She was given a \r\nhard brace based on an OT evaluation. Ecchymosis on head was \r\nimproving at discharge. She will continue to wear the brace \r\nuntil symptoms improve.\r\n\r\n#MDS ___ Allo MUD SCT\r\nShe was conditioned with Flu/Bu/ATG RI and was on cyclosporine \r\nfor immunosuppression. Her home cyclosporine dosage was 75mg QAM \r\nand 50mg QPM. Initial cyclosporine levels were low and her \r\ndosage was increased to 100mg BID. Her creatinine increased on \r\nthis dose and she was discharged on dosage of 75mg BID. Her home \r\nprophylaxis with fluconazole, Bactrim, and valganciclovir was \r\ninitially continued. However, given worsening neutropenia, her \r\nBactrim was transitioned to atovaquone and her valganciclovir \r\nwas transitioned to acyclovir. She was scheduled to have a bone \r\nmarrow biopsy with ___ as an outpatient on ___ but this was \r\ncancelled due to patient's new DVT. She will need to have a bone \r\nmarrow biopsy done as an outpatient.\r\n\r\n#DVT\r\nEnoxaparin was held ___ for possible LP but a US LLE \r\nperformed due to the concern of an abscess revealed a new distal \r\nDVT on ___ in LLE. LP was deferred due to resolution of her \r\nheadache and lack of neurologic symptoms and she was put on a \r\ntherapeutic dose of Enoxaparin. Her lower extremity swelling \r\nimproved and she was discharged on Enoxaparin 80mg BID.\r\n\r\n___\r\nShe presented with Cr above baseline at 1.7 No casts were \r\nvisualized on UA and she had a FENa of 1.7% on ___, indicating \r\nprerenal etiology. She was given fluids and her creatinine \r\nreturned to baseline. Her Cr increased again on ___ to 1.4. She \r\nwas again given IVF and her cyclosporine was decreased from \r\n100mg BID to 75mg BID. Cr at discharge improved to 1.2.\r\n\r\n#Asthma\r\nAlbuterol and duonebs were given as needed\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\r\n===================\r\n[] Follow up with Dr. ___ on ___\r\n[] Continue daptomycin and Vancomycin/heparin locks until ___.\r\n[] Will need to get weekly CK levels while on daptomycin.\r\n[] Repeat bone marrow biopsy scheduled for ___ was cancelled \r\ngiven new DVT and infection.

It intensified \r\nthroughout\r\nthe day and then in the afternoon she started vomiting numerous\r\ntimes. Which prompted her to go to the ED. She states the\r\nheadache was similar in location to when she gets migraines but\r\nthe duration was different and with migraines she usually gets\r\none episode of nausea in the morning and then it resolves. She\r\ndenies any neck stiffness, rashes, or fevers. She also denies \r\nany\r\nshortness of breath, diarrhea, or dysuria. \r\nShe went to the ED last night and had a head CT done which was \r\nunremarkable. She was then given Tylenol, dexamethasone,\r\nBenadryl, IV fluids, and Compazine. With improvement of her\r\nsymptoms. She then was discharged home early this morning. \r\nHer primary oncology team was concerned about the underlying\r\ncause of her headache given her history of a recent bone marrow\r\ntransplant and that she is on immunosuppression.

She \r\nalso had history of R internal carotid cavernous sinus aneurysm \r\nwith coiling in the past. An MRI head ___ was unremarkable. CMV, \r\nEBV, HSV, HHV6, adeno, ___, arboviruses, Lyme, \r\ncrypotococcus, and fungal markers were tested and all were \r\nnegative. The patient's headache resolved and she was symptom \r\nfree at time of discharge. \r\n\r\n#S. epidermidis Bacteremia\r\nShe had fevers up to 103 on ___ and was started on vancomycin \r\nand cefepime. The vancomycin was DC'd ___ overnight and she was \r\nstarted on linezolid per ID recommendations as she had a history \r\nof VRE bacteremia in the past and was continued on cefepime. ___ \r\nblood culture bottles grew S. epidermidis and she was narrowed \r\nto vancomycin only. A chest x-ray was unremarkable for \r\npneumonia. A CT chest ___ revealed no evidence of pneumonia. A \r\nCT abdomen pelvis ___ did not show any evidence of infection. An \r\nultrasound of her port site was without evidence of infection. \r\nAn ultrasound of her LLE ordered for concern of an abscess \r\nrevealed a distal DVT but no fluid collections. A TTE revealed \r\nnormal biventricular cavity sizes with mild global left \r\nventricular hypokinesis, mild mitral regurgitation with normal \r\nvalve morphology and trace aortic regurgitation with normal \r\nvalve morphology. A TEE was scheduled but was cancelled as \r\npatient will need 6 weeks of therapy for treatment of possible \r\nseptic thrombophlebitis. She was continued on Vancomycin until \r\n___ and was transitioned to Daptomycin on ___ as her \r\nVancomycin level fluctuated frequently throughout her \r\nhospitalization, making dosing of the medication challenging. \r\nShe will need to remain on Daptomycin until ___ to complete 6 \r\nweeks of antibiotic therapy.\r\n\r\n#Mechanical Fall\r\nPatient had a mechanical fall during the evening of ___. She \r\nbecame incontinent of urine and slipped and fell while trying to \r\nmake it to the bathroom. CT head and C spine were unremarkable. \r\nX rays of her left wrist revealed no fractures. She was given a \r\nhard brace based on an OT evaluation. Ecchymosis on head was \r\nimproving at discharge. She will continue to wear the brace \r\nuntil symptoms improve.\r\n\r\n#MDS ___ Allo MUD SCT\r\nShe was conditioned with Flu/Bu/ATG RI and was on cyclosporine \r\nfor immunosuppression. Her home cyclosporine dosage was 75mg QAM \r\nand 50mg QPM. Initial cyclosporine levels were low and her \r\ndosage was increased to 100mg BID.

She \r\nalso had history of R internal carotid cavernous sinus aneurysm \r\nwith coiling in the past. An MRI head ___ was unremarkable. CMV, \r\nEBV, HSV, HHV6, adeno, ___, arboviruses, Lyme, \r\ncrypotococcus, and fungal markers were tested and all were \r\nnegative. The patient's headache resolved and she was symptom \r\nfree at time of discharge. \r\n\r\n#S. epidermidis Bacteremia\r\nShe had fevers up to 103 on ___ and was started on vancomycin \r\nand cefepime. The vancomycin was DC'd ___ overnight and she was \r\nstarted on linezolid per ID recommendations as she had a history \r\nof VRE bacteremia in the past and was continued on cefepime. ___ \r\nblood culture bottles grew S. epidermidis and she was narrowed \r\nto vancomycin only. A chest x-ray was unremarkable for \r\npneumonia. A CT chest ___ revealed no evidence of pneumonia. A \r\nCT abdomen pelvis ___ did not show any evidence of infection. An \r\nultrasound of her port site was without evidence of infection. \r\nAn ultrasound of her LLE ordered for concern of an abscess \r\nrevealed a distal DVT but no fluid collections. A TTE revealed \r\nnormal biventricular cavity sizes with mild global left \r\nventricular hypokinesis, mild mitral regurgitation with normal \r\nvalve morphology and trace aortic regurgitation with normal \r\nvalve morphology. A TEE was scheduled but was cancelled as \r\npatient will need 6 weeks of therapy for treatment of possible \r\nseptic thrombophlebitis. She was continued on Vancomycin until \r\n___ and was transitioned to Daptomycin on ___ as her \r\nVancomycin level fluctuated frequently throughout her \r\nhospitalization, making dosing of the medication challenging. \r\nShe will need to remain on Daptomycin until ___ to complete 6 \r\nweeks of antibiotic therapy.\r\n\r\n#Mechanical Fall\r\nPatient had a mechanical fall during the evening of ___. She \r\nbecame incontinent of urine and slipped and fell while trying to \r\nmake it to the bathroom. CT head and C spine were unremarkable. \r\nX rays of her left wrist revealed no fractures.

She \r\nalso had history of R internal carotid cavernous sinus aneurysm \r\nwith coiling in the past. An MRI head ___ was unremarkable. CMV, \r\nEBV, HSV, HHV6, adeno, ___, arboviruses, Lyme, \r\ncrypotococcus, and fungal markers were tested and all were \r\nnegative. The patient's headache resolved and she was symptom \r\nfree at time of discharge. \r\n\r\n#S. epidermidis Bacteremia\r\nShe had fevers up to 103 on ___ and was started on vancomycin \r\nand cefepime. The vancomycin was DC'd ___ overnight and she was \r\nstarted on linezolid per ID recommendations as she had a history \r\nof VRE bacteremia in the past and was continued on cefepime. ___ \r\nblood culture bottles grew S. epidermidis and she was narrowed \r\nto vancomycin only. A chest x-ray was unremarkable for \r\npneumonia. A CT chest ___ revealed no evidence of pneumonia. A \r\nCT abdomen pelvis ___ did not show any evidence of infection. An \r\nultrasound of her port site was without evidence of infection. \r\nAn ultrasound of her LLE ordered for concern of an abscess \r\nrevealed a distal DVT but no fluid collections. A TTE revealed \r\nnormal biventricular cavity sizes with mild global left \r\nventricular hypokinesis, mild mitral regurgitation with normal \r\nvalve morphology and trace aortic regurgitation with normal \r\nvalve morphology. A TEE was scheduled but was cancelled as \r\npatient will need 6 weeks of therapy for treatment of possible \r\nseptic thrombophlebitis. She was continued on Vancomycin until \r\n___ and was transitioned to Daptomycin on ___ as her \r\nVancomycin level fluctuated frequently throughout her \r\nhospitalization, making dosing of the medication challenging. \r\nShe will need to remain on Daptomycin until ___ to complete 6 \r\nweeks of antibiotic therapy.\r\n\r\n#Mechanical Fall\r\nPatient had a mechanical fall during the evening of ___. She \r\nbecame incontinent of urine and slipped and fell while trying to \r\nmake it to the bathroom. CT head and C spine were unremarkable. \r\nX rays of her left wrist revealed no fractures.

She \r\nalso had history of R internal carotid cavernous sinus aneurysm \r\nwith coiling in the past. An MRI head ___ was unremarkable. CMV, \r\nEBV, HSV, HHV6, adeno, ___, arboviruses, Lyme, \r\ncrypotococcus, and fungal markers were tested and all were \r\nnegative. The patient's headache resolved and she was symptom \r\nfree at time of discharge. \r\n\r\n#S. epidermidis Bacteremia\r\nShe had fevers up to 103 on ___ and was started on vancomycin \r\nand cefepime. The vancomycin was DC'd ___ overnight and she was \r\nstarted on linezolid per ID recommendations as she had a history \r\nof VRE bacteremia in the past and was continued on cefepime. ___ \r\nblood culture bottles grew S. epidermidis and she was narrowed \r\nto vancomycin only. A chest x-ray was unremarkable for \r\npneumonia. A CT chest ___ revealed no evidence of pneumonia. A \r\nCT abdomen pelvis ___ did not show any evidence of infection. An \r\nultrasound of her port site was without evidence of infection. \r\nAn ultrasound of her LLE ordered for concern of an abscess \r\nrevealed a distal DVT but no fluid collections. A TTE revealed \r\nnormal biventricular cavity sizes with mild global left \r\nventricular hypokinesis, mild mitral regurgitation with normal \r\nvalve morphology and trace aortic regurgitation with normal \r\nvalve morphology. A TEE was scheduled but was cancelled as \r\npatient will need 6 weeks of therapy for treatment of possible \r\nseptic thrombophlebitis. She was continued on Vancomycin until \r\n___ and was transitioned to Daptomycin on ___ as her \r\nVancomycin level fluctuated frequently throughout her \r\nhospitalization, making dosing of the medication challenging. \r\nShe will need to remain on Daptomycin until ___ to complete 6 \r\nweeks of antibiotic therapy.\r\n\r\n#Mechanical Fall\r\nPatient had a mechanical fall during the evening of ___. She \r\nbecame incontinent of urine and slipped and fell while trying to \r\nmake it to the bathroom. CT head and C spine were unremarkable. \r\nX rays of her left wrist revealed no fractures.

Her home cyclosporine dosage was 75mg QAM \r\nand 50mg QPM. Initial cyclosporine levels were low and her \r\ndosage was increased to 100mg BID. Her creatinine increased on \r\nthis dose and she was discharged on dosage of 75mg BID. Her home \r\nprophylaxis with fluconazole, Bactrim, and valganciclovir was \r\ninitially continued. However, given worsening neutropenia, her \r\nBactrim was transitioned to atovaquone and her valganciclovir \r\nwas transitioned to acyclovir. She was scheduled to have a bone \r\nmarrow biopsy with ___ as an outpatient on ___ but this was \r\ncancelled due to patient's new DVT. She will need to have a bone \r\nmarrow biopsy done as an outpatient.\r\n\r\n#DVT\r\nEnoxaparin was held ___ for possible LP but a US LLE \r\nperformed due to the concern of an abscess revealed a new distal \r\nDVT on ___ in LLE. LP was deferred due to resolution of her \r\nheadache and lack of neurologic symptoms and she was put on a \r\ntherapeutic dose of Enoxaparin. Her lower extremity swelling \r\nimproved and she was discharged on Enoxaparin 80mg BID.\r\n\r\n___\r\nShe presented with Cr above baseline at 1.7 No casts were \r\nvisualized on UA and she had a FENa of 1.7% on ___, indicating \r\nprerenal etiology. She was given fluids and her creatinine \r\nreturned to baseline. Her Cr increased again on ___ to 1.4. She \r\nwas again given IVF and her cyclosporine was decreased from \r\n100mg BID to 75mg BID.

She \r\nalso had history of R internal carotid cavernous sinus aneurysm \r\nwith coiling in the past. An MRI head ___ was unremarkable. CMV, \r\nEBV, HSV, HHV6, adeno, ___, arboviruses, Lyme, \r\ncrypotococcus, and fungal markers were tested and all were \r\nnegative. The patient's headache resolved and she was symptom \r\nfree at time of discharge. \r\n\r\n#S. epidermidis Bacteremia\r\nShe had fevers up to 103 on ___ and was started on vancomycin \r\nand cefepime. The vancomycin was DC'd ___ overnight and she was \r\nstarted on linezolid per ID recommendations as she had a history \r\nof VRE bacteremia in the past and was continued on cefepime. ___ \r\nblood culture bottles grew S. epidermidis and she was narrowed \r\nto vancomycin only. A chest x-ray was unremarkable for \r\npneumonia. A CT chest ___ revealed no evidence of pneumonia. A \r\nCT abdomen pelvis ___ did not show any evidence of infection. An \r\nultrasound of her port site was without evidence of infection. \r\nAn ultrasound of her LLE ordered for concern of an abscess \r\nrevealed a distal DVT but no fluid collections. A TTE revealed \r\nnormal biventricular cavity sizes with mild global left \r\nventricular hypokinesis, mild mitral regurgitation with normal \r\nvalve morphology and trace aortic regurgitation with normal \r\nvalve morphology. A TEE was scheduled but was cancelled as \r\npatient will need 6 weeks of therapy for treatment of possible \r\nseptic thrombophlebitis. She was continued on Vancomycin until \r\n___ and was transitioned to Daptomycin on ___ as her \r\nVancomycin level fluctuated frequently throughout her \r\nhospitalization, making dosing of the medication challenging. \r\nShe will need to remain on Daptomycin until ___ to complete 6 \r\nweeks of antibiotic therapy.\r\n\r\n#Mechanical Fall\r\nPatient had a mechanical fall during the evening of ___.

She \r\nalso had history of R internal carotid cavernous sinus aneurysm \r\nwith coiling in the past. An MRI head ___ was unremarkable. CMV, \r\nEBV, HSV, HHV6, adeno, ___, arboviruses, Lyme, \r\ncrypotococcus, and fungal markers were tested and all were \r\nnegative. The patient's headache resolved and she was symptom \r\nfree at time of discharge. \r\n\r\n#S. epidermidis Bacteremia\r\nShe had fevers up to 103 on ___ and was started on vancomycin \r\nand cefepime. The vancomycin was DC'd ___ overnight and she was \r\nstarted on linezolid per ID recommendations as she had a history \r\nof VRE bacteremia in the past and was continued on cefepime. ___ \r\nblood culture bottles grew S. epidermidis and she was narrowed \r\nto vancomycin only. A chest x-ray was unremarkable for \r\npneumonia. A CT chest ___ revealed no evidence of pneumonia. A \r\nCT abdomen pelvis ___ did not show any evidence of infection. An \r\nultrasound of her port site was without evidence of infection. \r\nAn ultrasound of her LLE ordered for concern of an abscess \r\nrevealed a distal DVT but no fluid collections. A TTE revealed \r\nnormal biventricular cavity sizes with mild global left \r\nventricular hypokinesis, mild mitral regurgitation with normal \r\nvalve morphology and trace aortic regurgitation with normal \r\nvalve morphology. A TEE was scheduled but was cancelled as \r\npatient will need 6 weeks of therapy for treatment of possible \r\nseptic thrombophlebitis. She was continued on Vancomycin until \r\n___ and was transitioned to Daptomycin on ___ as her \r\nVancomycin level fluctuated frequently throughout her \r\nhospitalization, making dosing of the medication challenging. \r\nShe will need to remain on Daptomycin until ___ to complete 6 \r\nweeks of antibiotic therapy.\r\n\r\n#Mechanical Fall\r\nPatient had a mechanical fall during the evening of ___.

Her creatinine increased on \r\nthis dose and she was discharged on dosage of 75mg BID. Her home \r\nprophylaxis with fluconazole, Bactrim, and valganciclovir was \r\ninitially continued. However, given worsening neutropenia, her \r\nBactrim was transitioned to atovaquone and her valganciclovir \r\nwas transitioned to acyclovir. She was scheduled to have a bone \r\nmarrow biopsy with ___ as an outpatient on ___ but this was \r\ncancelled due to patient's new DVT. She will need to have a bone \r\nmarrow biopsy done as an outpatient.\r\n\r\n#DVT\r\nEnoxaparin was held ___ for possible LP but a US LLE \r\nperformed due to the concern of an abscess revealed a new distal \r\nDVT on ___ in LLE. LP was deferred due to resolution of her \r\nheadache and lack of neurologic symptoms and she was put on a \r\ntherapeutic dose of Enoxaparin. Her lower extremity swelling \r\nimproved and she was discharged on Enoxaparin 80mg BID.\r\n\r\n___\r\nShe presented with Cr above baseline at 1.7 No casts were \r\nvisualized on UA and she had a FENa of 1.7% on ___, indicating \r\nprerenal etiology.

She was then\r\ntreated with palvilizumab on ___ and ribavirin 600mg q 8h\r\nfrom ___. She received IVIG 10 grams daily for 4\r\ndays from ___. She required a tooth extraction on\r\nthe lower left side on ___ due to persistent tooth pain.\r\n\r\nFollowing recovery of her respiratory symptoms and dental \r\nissues,\r\nMs. ___ was admitted on ___ for her MUD allogeneic\r\ntransplant with Fludarabine, Busulfan and ATG conditioning. Her\r\nallogeneic transplantation course was complicated by aseptic\r\nmenigitis, CMV viremia, S. epidermidis bacteremia, DVT's of \r\nlower\r\nlegs, and GVDH. \r\n\r\nShe was last seen outpatient on ___. During this visit, \r\nshe did not have any URI symptoms. She reported using her\r\ninhalers as needed only. She noted some diarrhea and vomiting\r\nwhich persisted for several days and then stopped. Overall, she\r\nreported feeling well without sick contacts. \r\n\r\nSince the visit on ___, she reported that the several days \r\n(4\r\ndays ago), she was more fatigue, had mild sore throat, and had\r\nexposure to sick contacts with URI symptoms. She noted increased\r\ncough and wheezing but this improved somewhat with inhaler and \r\nso\r\nshe felt she was improving. However, on ___, she\r\nstarted feeling unwell again. On ___, she visited a\r\nlocal urgent care and was found to have a fever of 100.7. At \r\nthis\r\npoint, she was coughing more with increased wheezing and \r\nfatigue.\r\n\r\nIn addition, she noticed a headache (somewhat typical of her\r\nmigraines) that wrapped around her head like a \"C\". The headache\r\nstarted from the back of the head and progressed into the \r\nfrontal\r\npart of her head. She did not notice any visual disturbances,\r\nlightheadedness, or dizziness. The headache appeared to be worse\r\nwith increased cough but was not associated with visual\r\ndisturbances, nausea, or vomiting. Her appetite has diminished\r\nsignificantly - she did eat or drink adequately for almost the\r\npast 48 hours. The provider at the urgent care advised her to\r\ncome to the ED and so she called the ___ fellow who directed her\r\nto the ___ ED. \r\n\r\nIn the ED, her initial vitals were: T 99-100.2, HR 104-103, BP\r\n114-134/52-66, RR ___, SPO2 95-97% RA. Lung examination was\r\nsignificant for loud audible cough, diffuse wheezing, and\r\ncrackles. Labs were remarkable for WBC 13.4, HGB 12.9, plt 229, \r\nCr 1.3 and lactate 1.1. Flu negative. She was given albuterol\r\nnebs, DuoNeb, and IVF. CXR showed RLL opacity c/f pneumonia. \r\nGiven CXR findings, she was given cefepime IV and vancomycin IV. \r\n\r\nShe was also noted to have increased 02 requirement (RA on\r\ninitial ED visit then became hypoxic, ___ via NC). This \r\nprompted\r\nCTA CHEST  (given DVT hx) but fortunately, CT chest did not show\r\nevidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic abnormality but did\r\nreveal consolidation in nodular opacities with perihilar and\r\nperipheral consolidation and surrounding ground glass which are\r\nmost severe in the right lower and upper lobe with additional\r\nfindings in the left lower lobe. \r\n \r\nOn arrival to ___ unit, she reported that her cough and wheezing\r\nis still profound. No sore throat, headache or night sweats. She\r\ndenies chills, rigors, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, \r\ndysuria,\r\nhematuria, leg swelling. No rash in her groin area but does have\r\nmultiple creams prescribed by dermatology due to various skin\r\nrashes and GVHD. Erythema of right shin improved per patient\r\nreport - reported injury to RLE ~ 6 weeks ago that appears to\r\nhave no healed completely - no worsening erythema or\r\npain/discharge. Usual numbness of right toes following prior\r\nsurgery; has noted some increased sensations on the bottom of \r\nhis\r\nfeet.  \r\n\r\n \r\nPast Medical History:\r\nTRANSPLANT DATA (PER OMR)\r\n===================================\r\nTransplant Date: ___\r\nGraft: URD\r\nConditioning Intensity: Reduced-Intensity\r\nConditioning Regimen: Flu/Bu/ATG\r\nDonor Info: ___ CMV(+), ABO: Opos\r\nRecipient Info: CMV(+), ABO: Opos    \r\n\r\nPOST TRANSPLANT COURSE (PER OMR)\r\n==================================== \r\n*D0 = ___.

She was then\r\ntreated with palvilizumab on ___ and ribavirin 600mg q 8h\r\nfrom ___. She received IVIG 10 grams daily for 4\r\ndays from ___. She required a tooth extraction on\r\nthe lower left side on ___ due to persistent tooth pain.\r\n\r\nFollowing recovery of her respiratory symptoms and dental \r\nissues,\r\nMs. ___ was admitted on ___ for her MUD allogeneic\r\ntransplant with Fludarabine, Busulfan and ATG conditioning. Her\r\nallogeneic transplantation course was complicated by aseptic\r\nmenigitis, CMV viremia, S. epidermidis bacteremia, DVT's of \r\nlower\r\nlegs, and GVDH. \r\n\r\nShe was last seen outpatient on ___. During this visit, \r\nshe did not have any URI symptoms. She reported using her\r\ninhalers as needed only. She noted some diarrhea and vomiting\r\nwhich persisted for several days and then stopped. Overall, she\r\nreported feeling well without sick contacts. \r\n\r\nSince the visit on ___, she reported that the several days \r\n(4\r\ndays ago), she was more fatigue, had mild sore throat, and had\r\nexposure to sick contacts with URI symptoms. She noted increased\r\ncough and wheezing but this improved somewhat with inhaler and \r\nso\r\nshe felt she was improving. However, on ___, she\r\nstarted feeling unwell again. On ___, she visited a\r\nlocal urgent care and was found to have a fever of 100.7. At \r\nthis\r\npoint, she was coughing more with increased wheezing and \r\nfatigue.\r\n\r\nIn addition, she noticed a headache (somewhat typical of her\r\nmigraines) that wrapped around her head like a \"C\". The headache\r\nstarted from the back of the head and progressed into the \r\nfrontal\r\npart of her head. She did not notice any visual disturbances,\r\nlightheadedness, or dizziness. The headache appeared to be worse\r\nwith increased cough but was not associated with visual\r\ndisturbances, nausea, or vomiting. Her appetite has diminished\r\nsignificantly - she did eat or drink adequately for almost the\r\npast 48 hours. The provider at the urgent care advised her to\r\ncome to the ED and so she called the ___ fellow who directed her\r\nto the ___ ED. \r\n\r\nIn the ED, her initial vitals were: T 99-100.2, HR 104-103, BP\r\n114-134/52-66, RR ___, SPO2 95-97% RA. Lung examination was\r\nsignificant for loud audible cough, diffuse wheezing, and\r\ncrackles. Labs were remarkable for WBC 13.4, HGB 12.9, plt 229, \r\nCr 1.3 and lactate 1.1. Flu negative. She was given albuterol\r\nnebs, DuoNeb, and IVF. CXR showed RLL opacity c/f pneumonia. \r\nGiven CXR findings, she was given cefepime IV and vancomycin IV. \r\n\r\nShe was also noted to have increased 02 requirement (RA on\r\ninitial ED visit then became hypoxic, ___ via NC). This \r\nprompted\r\nCTA CHEST  (given DVT hx) but fortunately, CT chest did not show\r\nevidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic abnormality but did\r\nreveal consolidation in nodular opacities with perihilar and\r\nperipheral consolidation and surrounding ground glass which are\r\nmost severe in the right lower and upper lobe with additional\r\nfindings in the left lower lobe. \r\n \r\nOn arrival to ___ unit, she reported that her cough and wheezing\r\nis still profound. No sore throat, headache or night sweats. She\r\ndenies chills, rigors, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, \r\ndysuria,\r\nhematuria, leg swelling. No rash in her groin area but does have\r\nmultiple creams prescribed by dermatology due to various skin\r\nrashes and GVHD. Erythema of right shin improved per patient\r\nreport - reported injury to RLE ~ 6 weeks ago that appears to\r\nhave no healed completely - no worsening erythema or\r\npain/discharge.

She was then\r\ntreated with palvilizumab on ___ and ribavirin 600mg q 8h\r\nfrom ___. She received IVIG 10 grams daily for 4\r\ndays from ___. She required a tooth extraction on\r\nthe lower left side on ___ due to persistent tooth pain.\r\n\r\nFollowing recovery of her respiratory symptoms and dental \r\nissues,\r\nMs. ___ was admitted on ___ for her MUD allogeneic\r\ntransplant with Fludarabine, Busulfan and ATG conditioning. Her\r\nallogeneic transplantation course was complicated by aseptic\r\nmenigitis, CMV viremia, S. epidermidis bacteremia, DVT's of \r\nlower\r\nlegs, and GVDH. \r\n\r\nShe was last seen outpatient on ___. During this visit, \r\nshe did not have any URI symptoms. She reported using her\r\ninhalers as needed only. She noted some diarrhea and vomiting\r\nwhich persisted for several days and then stopped. Overall, she\r\nreported feeling well without sick contacts. \r\n\r\nSince the visit on ___, she reported that the several days \r\n(4\r\ndays ago), she was more fatigue, had mild sore throat, and had\r\nexposure to sick contacts with URI symptoms. She noted increased\r\ncough and wheezing but this improved somewhat with inhaler and \r\nso\r\nshe felt she was improving. However, on ___, she\r\nstarted feeling unwell again. On ___, she visited a\r\nlocal urgent care and was found to have a fever of 100.7. At \r\nthis\r\npoint, she was coughing more with increased wheezing and \r\nfatigue.\r\n\r\nIn addition, she noticed a headache (somewhat typical of her\r\nmigraines) that wrapped around her head like a \"C\". The headache\r\nstarted from the back of the head and progressed into the \r\nfrontal\r\npart of her head. She did not notice any visual disturbances,\r\nlightheadedness, or dizziness. The headache appeared to be worse\r\nwith increased cough but was not associated with visual\r\ndisturbances, nausea, or vomiting. Her appetite has diminished\r\nsignificantly - she did eat or drink adequately for almost the\r\npast 48 hours. The provider at the urgent care advised her to\r\ncome to the ED and so she called the ___ fellow who directed her\r\nto the ___ ED. \r\n\r\nIn the ED, her initial vitals were: T 99-100.2, HR 104-103, BP\r\n114-134/52-66, RR ___, SPO2 95-97% RA. Lung examination was\r\nsignificant for loud audible cough, diffuse wheezing, and\r\ncrackles. Labs were remarkable for WBC 13.4, HGB 12.9, plt 229, \r\nCr 1.3 and lactate 1.1. Flu negative. She was given albuterol\r\nnebs, DuoNeb, and IVF. CXR showed RLL opacity c/f pneumonia. \r\nGiven CXR findings, she was given cefepime IV and vancomycin IV. \r\n\r\nShe was also noted to have increased 02 requirement (RA on\r\ninitial ED visit then became hypoxic, ___ via NC). This \r\nprompted\r\nCTA CHEST  (given DVT hx) but fortunately, CT chest did not show\r\nevidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic abnormality but did\r\nreveal consolidation in nodular opacities with perihilar and\r\nperipheral consolidation and surrounding ground glass which are\r\nmost severe in the right lower and upper lobe with additional\r\nfindings in the left lower lobe. \r\n \r\nOn arrival to ___ unit, she reported that her cough and wheezing\r\nis still profound. No sore throat, headache or night sweats. She\r\ndenies chills, rigors, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, \r\ndysuria,\r\nhematuria, leg swelling. No rash in her groin area but does have\r\nmultiple creams prescribed by dermatology due to various skin\r\nrashes and GVHD. Erythema of right shin improved per patient\r\nreport - reported injury to RLE ~ 6 weeks ago that appears to\r\nhave no healed completely - no worsening erythema or\r\npain/discharge.

She was then\r\ntreated with palvilizumab on ___ and ribavirin 600mg q 8h\r\nfrom ___. She received IVIG 10 grams daily for 4\r\ndays from ___. She required a tooth extraction on\r\nthe lower left side on ___ due to persistent tooth pain.\r\n\r\nFollowing recovery of her respiratory symptoms and dental \r\nissues,\r\nMs. ___ was admitted on ___ for her MUD allogeneic\r\ntransplant with Fludarabine, Busulfan and ATG conditioning. Her\r\nallogeneic transplantation course was complicated by aseptic\r\nmenigitis, CMV viremia, S. epidermidis bacteremia, DVT's of \r\nlower\r\nlegs, and GVDH. \r\n\r\nShe was last seen outpatient on ___. During this visit, \r\nshe did not have any URI symptoms. She reported using her\r\ninhalers as needed only. She noted some diarrhea and vomiting\r\nwhich persisted for several days and then stopped. Overall, she\r\nreported feeling well without sick contacts. \r\n\r\nSince the visit on ___, she reported that the several days \r\n(4\r\ndays ago), she was more fatigue, had mild sore throat, and had\r\nexposure to sick contacts with URI symptoms. She noted increased\r\ncough and wheezing but this improved somewhat with inhaler and \r\nso\r\nshe felt she was improving. However, on ___, she\r\nstarted feeling unwell again. On ___, she visited a\r\nlocal urgent care and was found to have a fever of 100.7. At \r\nthis\r\npoint, she was coughing more with increased wheezing and \r\nfatigue.\r\n\r\nIn addition, she noticed a headache (somewhat typical of her\r\nmigraines) that wrapped around her head like a \"C\". The headache\r\nstarted from the back of the head and progressed into the \r\nfrontal\r\npart of her head. She did not notice any visual disturbances,\r\nlightheadedness, or dizziness. The headache appeared to be worse\r\nwith increased cough but was not associated with visual\r\ndisturbances, nausea, or vomiting. Her appetite has diminished\r\nsignificantly - she did eat or drink adequately for almost the\r\npast 48 hours. The provider at the urgent care advised her to\r\ncome to the ED and so she called the ___ fellow who directed her\r\nto the ___ ED. \r\n\r\nIn the ED, her initial vitals were: T 99-100.2, HR 104-103, BP\r\n114-134/52-66, RR ___, SPO2 95-97% RA. Lung examination was\r\nsignificant for loud audible cough, diffuse wheezing, and\r\ncrackles. Labs were remarkable for WBC 13.4, HGB 12.9, plt 229, \r\nCr 1.3 and lactate 1.1. Flu negative. She was given albuterol\r\nnebs, DuoNeb, and IVF. CXR showed RLL opacity c/f pneumonia. \r\nGiven CXR findings, she was given cefepime IV and vancomycin IV. \r\n\r\nShe was also noted to have increased 02 requirement (RA on\r\ninitial ED visit then became hypoxic, ___ via NC). This \r\nprompted\r\nCTA CHEST  (given DVT hx) but fortunately, CT chest did not show\r\nevidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic abnormality but did\r\nreveal consolidation in nodular opacities with perihilar and\r\nperipheral consolidation and surrounding ground glass which are\r\nmost severe in the right lower and upper lobe with additional\r\nfindings in the left lower lobe. \r\n \r\nOn arrival to ___ unit, she reported that her cough and wheezing\r\nis still profound. No sore throat, headache or night sweats. She\r\ndenies chills, rigors, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, \r\ndysuria,\r\nhematuria, leg swelling. No rash in her groin area but does have\r\nmultiple creams prescribed by dermatology due to various skin\r\nrashes and GVHD. Erythema of right shin improved per patient\r\nreport - reported injury to RLE ~ 6 weeks ago that appears to\r\nhave no healed completely - no worsening erythema or\r\npain/discharge. Usual numbness of right toes following prior\r\nsurgery; has noted some increased sensations on the bottom of \r\nhis\r\nfeet.  \r\n\r\n \r\nPast Medical History:\r\nTRANSPLANT DATA (PER OMR)\r\n===================================\r\nTransplant Date: ___\r\nGraft: URD\r\nConditioning Intensity: Reduced-Intensity\r\nConditioning Regimen: Flu/Bu/ATG\r\nDonor Info: ___ CMV(+), ABO: Opos\r\nRecipient Info: CMV(+), ABO: Opos    \r\n\r\nPOST TRANSPLANT COURSE (PER OMR)\r\n==================================== \r\n*D0 = ___.

She was then\r\ntreated with palvilizumab on ___ and ribavirin 600mg q 8h\r\nfrom ___. She received IVIG 10 grams daily for 4\r\ndays from ___. She required a tooth extraction on\r\nthe lower left side on ___ due to persistent tooth pain.\r\n\r\nFollowing recovery of her respiratory symptoms and dental \r\nissues,\r\nMs. ___ was admitted on ___ for her MUD allogeneic\r\ntransplant with Fludarabine, Busulfan and ATG conditioning. Her\r\nallogeneic transplantation course was complicated by aseptic\r\nmenigitis, CMV viremia, S. epidermidis bacteremia, DVT's of \r\nlower\r\nlegs, and GVDH. \r\n\r\nShe was last seen outpatient on ___. During this visit, \r\nshe did not have any URI symptoms. She reported using her\r\ninhalers as needed only. She noted some diarrhea and vomiting\r\nwhich persisted for several days and then stopped. Overall, she\r\nreported feeling well without sick contacts. \r\n\r\nSince the visit on ___, she reported that the several days \r\n(4\r\ndays ago), she was more fatigue, had mild sore throat, and had\r\nexposure to sick contacts with URI symptoms. She noted increased\r\ncough and wheezing but this improved somewhat with inhaler and \r\nso\r\nshe felt she was improving. However, on ___, she\r\nstarted feeling unwell again. On ___, she visited a\r\nlocal urgent care and was found to have a fever of 100.7. At \r\nthis\r\npoint, she was coughing more with increased wheezing and \r\nfatigue.\r\n\r\nIn addition, she noticed a headache (somewhat typical of her\r\nmigraines) that wrapped around her head like a \"C\". The headache\r\nstarted from the back of the head and progressed into the \r\nfrontal\r\npart of her head. She did not notice any visual disturbances,\r\nlightheadedness, or dizziness. The headache appeared to be worse\r\nwith increased cough but was not associated with visual\r\ndisturbances, nausea, or vomiting. Her appetite has diminished\r\nsignificantly - she did eat or drink adequately for almost the\r\npast 48 hours. The provider at the urgent care advised her to\r\ncome to the ED and so she called the ___ fellow who directed her\r\nto the ___ ED. \r\n\r\nIn the ED, her initial vitals were: T 99-100.2, HR 104-103, BP\r\n114-134/52-66, RR ___, SPO2 95-97% RA. Lung examination was\r\nsignificant for loud audible cough, diffuse wheezing, and\r\ncrackles. Labs were remarkable for WBC 13.4, HGB 12.9, plt 229, \r\nCr 1.3 and lactate 1.1. Flu negative. She was given albuterol\r\nnebs, DuoNeb, and IVF. CXR showed RLL opacity c/f pneumonia. \r\nGiven CXR findings, she was given cefepime IV and vancomycin IV. \r\n\r\nShe was also noted to have increased 02 requirement (RA on\r\ninitial ED visit then became hypoxic, ___ via NC). This \r\nprompted\r\nCTA CHEST  (given DVT hx) but fortunately, CT chest did not show\r\nevidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic abnormality but did\r\nreveal consolidation in nodular opacities with perihilar and\r\nperipheral consolidation and surrounding ground glass which are\r\nmost severe in the right lower and upper lobe with additional\r\nfindings in the left lower lobe. \r\n \r\nOn arrival to ___ unit, she reported that her cough and wheezing\r\nis still profound. No sore throat, headache or night sweats. She\r\ndenies chills, rigors, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, \r\ndysuria,\r\nhematuria, leg swelling. No rash in her groin area but does have\r\nmultiple creams prescribed by dermatology due to various skin\r\nrashes and GVHD.

Her\r\nallogeneic transplantation course was complicated by aseptic\r\nmenigitis, CMV viremia, S. epidermidis bacteremia, DVT's of \r\nlower\r\nlegs, and GVDH. \r\n\r\nShe was last seen outpatient on ___. During this visit, \r\nshe did not have any URI symptoms. She reported using her\r\ninhalers as needed only. She noted some diarrhea and vomiting\r\nwhich persisted for several days and then stopped. Overall, she\r\nreported feeling well without sick contacts. \r\n\r\nSince the visit on ___, she reported that the several days \r\n(4\r\ndays ago), she was more fatigue, had mild sore throat, and had\r\nexposure to sick contacts with URI symptoms. She noted increased\r\ncough and wheezing but this improved somewhat with inhaler and \r\nso\r\nshe felt she was improving. However, on ___, she\r\nstarted feeling unwell again. On ___, she visited a\r\nlocal urgent care and was found to have a fever of 100.7. At \r\nthis\r\npoint, she was coughing more with increased wheezing and \r\nfatigue.\r\n\r\nIn addition, she noticed a headache (somewhat typical of her\r\nmigraines) that wrapped around her head like a \"C\". The headache\r\nstarted from the back of the head and progressed into the \r\nfrontal\r\npart of her head. She did not notice any visual disturbances,\r\nlightheadedness, or dizziness. The headache appeared to be worse\r\nwith increased cough but was not associated with visual\r\ndisturbances, nausea, or vomiting.

The provider at the urgent care advised her to\r\ncome to the ED and so she called the ___ fellow who directed her\r\nto the ___ ED. \r\n\r\nIn the ED, her initial vitals were: T 99-100.2, HR 104-103, BP\r\n114-134/52-66, RR ___, SPO2 95-97% RA. Lung examination was\r\nsignificant for loud audible cough, diffuse wheezing, and\r\ncrackles. Labs were remarkable for WBC 13.4, HGB 12.9, plt 229, \r\nCr 1.3 and lactate 1.1. Flu negative. She was given albuterol\r\nnebs, DuoNeb, and IVF. CXR showed RLL opacity c/f pneumonia. \r\nGiven CXR findings, she was given cefepime IV and vancomycin IV. \r\n\r\nShe was also noted to have increased 02 requirement (RA on\r\ninitial ED visit then became hypoxic, ___ via NC). This \r\nprompted\r\nCTA CHEST  (given DVT hx) but fortunately, CT chest did not show\r\nevidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic abnormality but did\r\nreveal consolidation in nodular opacities with perihilar and\r\nperipheral consolidation and surrounding ground glass which are\r\nmost severe in the right lower and upper lobe with additional\r\nfindings in the left lower lobe. \r\n \r\nOn arrival to ___ unit, she reported that her cough and wheezing\r\nis still profound. No sore throat, headache or night sweats. She\r\ndenies chills, rigors, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, \r\ndysuria,\r\nhematuria, leg swelling. No rash in her groin area but does have\r\nmultiple creams prescribed by dermatology due to various skin\r\nrashes and GVHD.

She required a tooth extraction on\r\nthe lower left side on ___ due to persistent tooth pain.\r\n\r\nFollowing recovery of her respiratory symptoms and dental \r\nissues,\r\nMs. ___ was admitted on ___ for her MUD allogeneic\r\ntransplant with Fludarabine, Busulfan and ATG conditioning. Her\r\nallogeneic transplantation course was complicated by aseptic\r\nmenigitis, CMV viremia, S. epidermidis bacteremia, DVT's of \r\nlower\r\nlegs, and GVDH. \r\n\r\nShe was last seen outpatient on ___. During this visit, \r\nshe did not have any URI symptoms. She reported using her\r\ninhalers as needed only. She noted some diarrhea and vomiting\r\nwhich persisted for several days and then stopped. Overall, she\r\nreported feeling well without sick contacts. \r\n\r\nSince the visit on ___, she reported that the several days \r\n(4\r\ndays ago), she was more fatigue, had mild sore throat, and had\r\nexposure to sick contacts with URI symptoms. She noted increased\r\ncough and wheezing but this improved somewhat with inhaler and \r\nso\r\nshe felt she was improving. However, on ___, she\r\nstarted feeling unwell again. On ___, she visited a\r\nlocal urgent care and was found to have a fever of 100.7.

She was then\r\ntreated with palvilizumab on ___ and ribavirin 600mg q 8h\r\nfrom ___. She received IVIG 10 grams daily for 4\r\ndays from ___. She required a tooth extraction on\r\nthe lower left side on ___ due to persistent tooth pain.\r\n\r\nFollowing recovery of her respiratory symptoms and dental \r\nissues,\r\nMs. ___ was admitted on ___ for her MUD allogeneic\r\ntransplant with Fludarabine, Busulfan and ATG conditioning. Her\r\nallogeneic transplantation course was complicated by aseptic\r\nmenigitis, CMV viremia, S. epidermidis bacteremia, DVT's of \r\nlower\r\nlegs, and GVDH. \r\n\r\nShe was last seen outpatient on ___. During this visit, \r\nshe did not have any URI symptoms. She reported using her\r\ninhalers as needed only. She noted some diarrhea and vomiting\r\nwhich persisted for several days and then stopped. Overall, she\r\nreported feeling well without sick contacts. \r\n\r\nSince the visit on ___, she reported that the several days \r\n(4\r\ndays ago), she was more fatigue, had mild sore throat, and had\r\nexposure to sick contacts with URI symptoms. She noted increased\r\ncough and wheezing but this improved somewhat with inhaler and \r\nso\r\nshe felt she was improving. However, on ___, she\r\nstarted feeling unwell again. On ___, she visited a\r\nlocal urgent care and was found to have a fever of 100.7. At \r\nthis\r\npoint, she was coughing more with increased wheezing and \r\nfatigue.\r\n\r\nIn addition, she noticed a headache (somewhat typical of her\r\nmigraines) that wrapped around her head like a \"C\". The headache\r\nstarted from the back of the head and progressed into the \r\nfrontal\r\npart of her head. She did not notice any visual disturbances,\r\nlightheadedness, or dizziness. The headache appeared to be worse\r\nwith increased cough but was not associated with visual\r\ndisturbances, nausea, or vomiting.

The provider at the urgent care advised her to\r\ncome to the ED and so she called the ___ fellow who directed her\r\nto the ___ ED. \r\n\r\nIn the ED, her initial vitals were: T 99-100.2, HR 104-103, BP\r\n114-134/52-66, RR ___, SPO2 95-97% RA. Lung examination was\r\nsignificant for loud audible cough, diffuse wheezing, and\r\ncrackles. Labs were remarkable for WBC 13.4, HGB 12.9, plt 229, \r\nCr 1.3 and lactate 1.1. Flu negative. She was given albuterol\r\nnebs, DuoNeb, and IVF. CXR showed RLL opacity c/f pneumonia. \r\nGiven CXR findings, she was given cefepime IV and vancomycin IV. \r\n\r\nShe was also noted to have increased 02 requirement (RA on\r\ninitial ED visit then became hypoxic, ___ via NC). This \r\nprompted\r\nCTA CHEST  (given DVT hx) but fortunately, CT chest did not show\r\nevidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic abnormality but did\r\nreveal consolidation in nodular opacities with perihilar and\r\nperipheral consolidation and surrounding ground glass which are\r\nmost severe in the right lower and upper lobe with additional\r\nfindings in the left lower lobe. \r\n \r\nOn arrival to ___ unit, she reported that her cough and wheezing\r\nis still profound. No sore throat, headache or night sweats. She\r\ndenies chills, rigors, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, \r\ndysuria,\r\nhematuria, leg swelling. No rash in her groin area but does have\r\nmultiple creams prescribed by dermatology due to various skin\r\nrashes and GVHD.

However, there is also fat stranding in the retro \r\nmaxillary fat pads, which raises the possibility of invasive \r\nfungal sinusitis in the context of immune suppression. \r\n2. Please see separate head CT for intracranial findings.\r\n\r\n___ CT HEAD:\r\nNo acute intracranial abnormalities are identified or change \r\nseen compared with ___.\r\n\r\n___ TTE:\r\nThe left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is mildly \r\nenlarged. There is no evidence for an atrial septal defect by \r\n2D/color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ \r\nmmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with \r\na normal cavity size. There is normal regional and global left \r\nventricular systolic function. Quantitative biplane left \r\nventricular ejection fraction is 56 % (normal 54-73%). Left \r\nventricular cardiac index is normal (>2.5 L/min/m2). There is no \r\nresting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. No ventricular \r\nseptal defect is seen. Normal right ventricular cavity size with \r\nnormal free wall motion. Tricuspid annular plane systolic \r\nexcursion (TAPSE) is normal. The aortic sinus diameter is normal \r\nfor gender with a mildly dilated ascending aorta. The aortic \r\narch diameter is normal with a normal descending aorta diameter. \r\nThe aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal. There \r\nis no aortic valve stenosis. There is no aortic regurgitation. \r\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with no mitral \r\nvalve prolapse. There is mild [1+] mitral regurgitation. The \r\npulmonic valve leaflets are normal. The tricuspid valve leaflets \r\nappear structurally normal. There is mild [1+] tricuspid \r\nregurgitation.
