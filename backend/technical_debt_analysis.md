# Technical Debt Analysis: Notes Retrieval System

## Executive Summary

The notes retrieval system has significant technical debt that results in **42.9% success rate** for notes retrieval across 56 patients. The system is plagued by rate limiting issues, inconsistent data sources, and architectural problems that need immediate attention.

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. **Rate Limiting Problems (HIGH PRIORITY)**
- **Issue:** 32/56 patients (57.1%) fail due to HTTP 429 "Rate limit exceeded"
- **Root Cause:** Backend has aggressive rate limiting that prevents normal operation
- **Impact:** Users cannot access notes for majority of patients
- **Severity:** 游댮 CRITICAL

### 2. **FHIR Server Connectivity Issues (HIGH PRIORITY)**
- **Issue:** All 56 patients fail FHIR existence checks (0% success rate)
- **Root Cause:** FHIR server at `http://localhost:8080` is not responding
- **Impact:** Cannot verify patient existence or fetch FHIR data
- **Severity:** 游댮 CRITICAL

### 3. **Data Source Inconsistency (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
- **Issue:** All patients have Excel data but no FHIR presence
- **Root Cause:** Data synchronization between Excel ingestion and FHIR server is broken
- **Impact:** Inconsistent patient data across systems
- **Severity:** 游리 HIGH

### 4. **Architecture Problems (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
- **Issue:** Multiple data sources (Excel, FHIR, Local DB) not properly integrated
- **Root Cause:** Lack of unified data layer and proper synchronization
- **Impact:** Complex data flow and potential data loss
- **Severity:** 游리 HIGH

## Technical Debt Categories

### **Infrastructure Debt**
1. **Rate Limiting Configuration**
   - Current: Too aggressive, blocking normal operations
   - Needed: Proper rate limiting that allows normal usage
   - Effort: 1-2 days

2. **FHIR Server Reliability**
   - Current: Unreliable local FHIR server
   - Needed: Stable FHIR server or fallback mechanisms
   - Effort: 2-3 days

### **Data Architecture Debt**
1. **Data Source Fragmentation**
   - Current: Excel, FHIR, and Local DB as separate sources
   - Needed: Unified data layer with proper synchronization
   - Effort: 3-5 days

2. **Patient ID Mapping**
   - Current: Inconsistent patient ID mapping between sources
   - Needed: Consistent patient identification across all systems
   - Effort: 2-3 days

### **Code Quality Debt**
1. **Error Handling**
   - Current: Poor error handling for rate limits and server failures
   - Needed: Robust error handling with retry mechanisms
   - Effort: 2-3 days

2. **Monitoring and Observability**
   - Current: No monitoring of system health
   - Needed: Health checks, metrics, and alerting
   - Effort: 2-3 days
