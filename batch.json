Significant interval increase size of an extra-axial frontal \r\nlobe \r\nparafalcine lesion, compatible with a meningioma.  Given the \r\nrapid growth in size am prominent peripheral FLAIR hyperintense \r\nsignal, this could represent an atypical meningioma. \r\n2. The lesion abuts the superior sagittal sinus without evidence \r\nof invasion. \r\n3. No additional lesions are identified. \r\n\r\nECG ___:  TRACING #4\r\nSinus arrhythmia. Compared to tracing #3 atrial and ventricular \r\npremature \r\nbeats are now not seen. T waves are probably improved. \r\nOtherwise, no change. \r\n\r\n  Intervals     Axes \r\nRate PR QRS QT QTc (___)    P QRS T \r\n76 186 96 422 450   63 -49 48 \r\n \r\nECG ___:  TRACING #3 \r\nSinus rhythm with atrial and ventricular premature beats. \r\nCompared to the \r\nprevious tracing of ___ the rate is now slower. There is \r\nless artifact. There is now more prominent T wave flattening in \r\nthe precordial leads. \r\n\r\n  Intervals     Axes \r\nRate PR QRS QT QTc (___)    P QRS T \r\n79 196 96 400 433   53 -45 51 \r\n \r\nECG ___:  TRACING #2 \r\nBaseline artifact. Probably sinus tachycardia with atrial \r\npremature beats and a single ventricular premature beat. Left \r\nanterior fascicular block. Consider voltage for left ventricular \r\nhypertrophy in leads I and III. Compared to the previous tracing \r\nheart rate is increased. Atrial premature beats and ventricular \r\npremature beats are new. Clinical correlation is suggested.  \r\n\r\n  Intervals     Axes \r\nRate PR QRS QT QTc (___)    P QRS T \r\n118 171 93 ___   44 -61 88 \r\n \r\nECG ___:   TRACING #1 \r\nSinus rhythm. Left axis deviation. Consider left anterior \r\nfascicular block.  Late R wave progression may be related to \r\nleft anterior fascicular block.  T wave abnormalities. No \r\nprevious tracing available for comparison. \r\n\r\n  Intervals     Axes \r\nRate PR QRS QT QTc (___)    P QRS T \r\n81 182 92 374 410   46 -51 20 \r\n \r\nEEG ___:\r\nIMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video EEG study as it \r\nshowed the presence of continuous background disorganization \r\nover the left hemisphere together with continuous focal mixed \r\nfrequency slowing in the left posterior quadrant. These findings \r\nare indicative of focal cerebral dysfunction which is \r\nnon-specific but may be due to a structural lesion in broadly \r\ndistributed over the left temporal/occipital regions. There were \r\nno epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures. There \r\nwere no pushbutton activations. \r\n\r\nCT Head ___:\r\nIMPRESSION: \r\n1. Moderately motion limited exam. \r\n2. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or large vascular \r\nterritorial infarction. \r\n3. 3.5 x 3.0 x 2.8 cm hyperdense mass centered in the anterior \r\ninterhemispheric fissure, significantly increased in size since \r\n___.  MRI is recommended for further evaluation. \r\n4. Chronic small vessel ischemic disease. \r\n\r\nPERTINENT MICRO:\r\n================\r\n\r\n___ 4:43 pm URINE\r\n                            **FINAL REPORT ___\r\n   URINE CULTURE (Final ___:    NO GROWTH.\r\n\r\n___:  Blood culture pending\r\n\r\n \r\nBrief Hospital Course:\r\n___ with a PMH of severe Alzheimer's, HCV infection and history \r\nof autoimmune hepatitis, who presented with an unresponspive \r\nepisode/syncope, concerning for seizure given appearance of \r\nlarge brain mass on head CT, now with MRI concerning for \r\natypical meningioma.  \r\n\r\nACTIVE ISSUES:\r\n==============\r\n\r\n# Atypical meningioma: \r\nPatient presented with an episode of syncope that most likely \r\nrepresented seizure given brain mass on MRI (per niece, did not \r\nactually occur on the toilet, episode occurred while patient \r\nseated at dinner table, making vasovagal syncope less likely).  \r\nCardiogenic causes also less likely, given her atrial \r\nfibrillation has been stable without any rate control agents \r\n(unclear if this is new).  No evidence of infection as \r\npredisposing factor.  Patient was not orthostatic after 2L IVF.  \r\nShe did not have further syncopal or presyncopal symptoms.  MRI \r\nbrain was performed that revealed a 3 cm mass in the \r\ninterhemispheric fissue with characteristics suggestive of an \r\natypical meningioma.  ___ discussed with niece; patient would \r\nnot want surgical intervention.  She was started Keppra 500 mg \r\nPO BID for seizure prophylaxis and discharged with outpatient \r\nneuro follow-up. \r\n\r\n# A. fib: \r\nParoxysmal, newly discovered in ED on this admission. CHADSVASC \r\nscore 4, so anticoagulation would be warranted; however, \r\ndecision was made not to anticoagulate given age, risk of fall, \r\nand intracranial lesion.  Location makes saggital sinus \r\nvulnerable to compression, increasing risk for venous bleed.  \r\nNiece in agreement with decision.\r\n\r\n# Fever, leukocytosis: \r\nPatient with new T 101 and WBC count of 12 on admission, \r\nresolved today.  Infectious ROS entirely negative, and lab work \r\nup unrevealing (UA clear, LFTs NWL, CXR clear).  It is possible \r\nthat she aspirated during her syncopal event.\r\n\r\n# ___: \r\nCr 1.3 on admission, returned to her baseline of 0.9 with \r\nhydration.  Most likely prerenal given presence of hyaline casts \r\nand resolution with IVF.\r\n\r\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\r\n===============\r\n\r\n# Autoimmune hepatitis  \r\nThe patient was continued on her home prednisone  \r\n\r\n# Hypertension  \r\nThe patient was continued on her home nifedipine  \r\n\r\n# Alzheimer's dementia\r\nThe patient's mental status remained at her baseline throughout \r\nthis hospitalization.  She was Continued on her home donepezil \r\nand memantine.  \r\n\r\n# CODE STATUS: DNR, DNI (confirmed)\r\n# CONTACT:  ___ ___\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n====================\r\n- Patient with a ~3 cm mass arising from the intrahemispheric \r\nfissue with imaging appearance consistent with an atypical \r\nmeningioma. In goals of care discussion with the patient's \r\nniece, surgical management was deferred. She was started on \r\nKeppra 500 mg PO BID for seizure prophylaxis and will follow-up \r\nwith her neurologist as an outpatient\r\n- Patient diagnosed with new atrial fibrillation on this \r\nadmission. She did not require any standing nodal agents for \r\nrate control. Regarding anticoagulation, it would be indicated \r\ngiven her high CHADS2-VASC score; however, given the location of \r\nher atypical meningioma, advanced dementia, and limited life \r\nexpectancy, anticoagulation was deferred. She was continued on \r\nher home aspirin 81 mg PO QD.\r\n- If she has uncontrolled heart rates in the future, consider \r\nstarting a low-dose long-acting beta blocker, such as Metoprolol \r\nsuccinate 12.5-25 mg PO QD.\r\n \r\nMedications on Admission:\r\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\r\n1. PredniSONE 5 mg PO DAILY \r\n2. Memantine 21 mg PO DAILY \r\n3. NIFEdipine CR 30 mg PO DAILY \r\n4. Multivitamins W/minerals 1 TAB PO DAILY \r\n5. Donepezil 10 mg PO QHS \r\n6. Aspirin 81 mg PO DAILY \r\n7. Vitamin E 400 UNIT PO DAILY \r\n\r\n \r\nDischarge Medications:\r\n1. Aspirin 81 mg PO DAILY \r\n2. Donepezil 10 mg PO QHS \r\n3. Memantine 21 mg PO DAILY \r\n4. Multivitamins W/minerals 1 TAB PO DAILY \r\n5. NIFEdipine CR 30 mg PO DAILY \r\n6. PredniSONE 5 mg PO DAILY \r\n7. Vitamin E 400 UNIT PO DAILY \r\n8. LeVETiracetam 500 mg PO BID \r\n\r\n \r\nDischarge Disposition:\r\nExtended Care\r\n \r\nFacility:\r\n___\r\n \r\nDischarge Diagnosis:\r\nPrimary: Seizure, atypical meningioma, atrial fibrillation \r\n \r\nSecondary: Alzheimer's dementia, hepatitis C virus infection, \r\nhypertension, autoimmune hepatitis \r\n\r\n \r\nDischarge Condition:\r\nMental Status: Confused - always.\r\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.\r\nActivity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker \r\nor cane).\r\n\r\n \r\nDischarge Instructions:\r\nDear Ms. ___,\r\n\r\nIt was our pleasure caring for you at ___ \r\n___.  You were admitted to the hospital after having \r\nwhat was most likely a seizure.  We did a scan of your head and \r\nfound a benign tumor called an atypical meningioma.  This may \r\nincrease your risk for seizure, so we are starting you on an \r\nantiseizure medication called Keppra, which you will continue to \r\ntake twice daily.  This benign tumor does not require any \r\nsurgery to remove or chemotherapy.\r\n\r\nWhile you were here, you also had evidence of a fast, abnormal \r\nheart rhythm called atrial fibrillation.  This can increase the \r\nrisk of stroke; however, the risks of giving you a blood thinner \r\nto decrease the risk of stroke probably outweigh the benefits, \r\nso in discussion with your neurologists, we opted not to start \r\nyou on anticoagulation.  Your neurologist can re-evaluate this \r\ndecision as an outpatient in case you or your neice would like \r\nto revisit this issue.\r\n\r\nThank you for allowing us to participate in your care.\r\n \r\nFollowup Instructions:\r\n___\r\n"

No evidence of infection as \r\npredisposing factor.  Patient was not orthostatic after 2L IVF.  \r\nShe did not have further syncopal or presyncopal symptoms.  MRI \r\nbrain was performed that revealed a 3 cm mass in the \r\ninterhemispheric fissue with characteristics suggestive of an \r\natypical meningioma.  ___ discussed with niece; patient would \r\nnot want surgical intervention.  She was started Keppra 500 mg \r\nPO BID for seizure prophylaxis and discharged with outpatient \r\nneuro follow-up. \r\n\r\n# A. fib: \r\nParoxysmal, newly discovered in ED on this admission. CHADSVASC \r\nscore 4, so anticoagulation would be warranted; however, \r\ndecision was made not to anticoagulate given age, risk of fall, \r\nand intracranial lesion.  Location makes saggital sinus \r\nvulnerable to compression, increasing risk for venous bleed.  \r\nNiece in agreement with decision.\r\n\r\n# Fever, leukocytosis: \r\nPatient with new T 101 and WBC count of 12 on admission, \r\nresolved today.  Infectious ROS entirely negative, and lab work \r\nup unrevealing (UA clear, LFTs NWL, CXR clear).  It is possible \r\nthat she aspirated during her syncopal event.\r\n\r\n# ___: \r\nCr 1.3 on admission, returned to her baseline of 0.9 with \r\nhydration.  Most likely prerenal given presence of hyaline casts \r\nand resolution with IVF.\r\n\r\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\r\n===============\r\n\r\n# Autoimmune hepatitis  \r\nThe patient was continued on her home prednisone  \r\n\r\n# Hypertension  \r\nThe patient was continued on her home nifedipine  \r\n\r\n# Alzheimer's dementia\r\nThe patient's mental status remained at her baseline throughout \r\nthis hospitalization.  She was Continued on her home donepezil \r\nand memantine.  \r\n\r\n# CODE STATUS: DNR, DNI (confirmed)\r\n# CONTACT:  ___ ___\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n====================\r\n- Patient with a ~3 cm mass arising from the intrahemispheric \r\nfissue with imaging appearance consistent with an atypical \r\nmeningioma. In goals of care discussion with the patient's \r\nniece, surgical management was deferred. She was started on \r\nKeppra 500 mg PO BID for seizure prophylaxis and will follow-up \r\nwith her neurologist as an outpatient\r\n- Patient diagnosed with new atrial fibrillation on this \r\nadmission. She did not require any standing nodal agents for \r\nrate control. Regarding anticoagulation, it would be indicated \r\ngiven her high CHADS2-VASC score; however, given the location of \r\nher atypical meningioma, advanced dementia, and limited life \r\nexpectancy, anticoagulation was deferred. She was continued on \r\nher home aspirin 81 mg PO QD.\r\n- If she has uncontrolled heart rates in the future, consider \r\nstarting a low-dose long-acting beta blocker, such as Metoprolol \r\nsuccinate 12.5-25 mg PO QD.\r\n \r\nMedications on Admission:\r\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\r\n1. PredniSONE 5 mg PO DAILY \r\n2. Memantine 21 mg PO DAILY \r\n3. NIFEdipine CR 30 mg PO DAILY \r\n4. Multivitamins W/minerals 1 TAB PO DAILY \r\n5. Donepezil 10 mg PO QHS \r\n6. Aspirin 81 mg PO DAILY \r\n7. Vitamin E 400 UNIT PO DAILY \r\n\r\n \r\nDischarge Medications:\r\n1. Aspirin 81 mg PO DAILY \r\n2. Donepezil 10 mg PO QHS \r\n3. Memantine 21 mg PO DAILY \r\n4. Multivitamins W/minerals 1 TAB PO DAILY \r\n5. NIFEdipine CR 30 mg PO DAILY \r\n6. PredniSONE 5 mg PO DAILY \r\n7. Vitamin E 400 UNIT PO DAILY \r\n8. LeVETiracetam 500 mg PO BID \r\n\r\n \r\nDischarge Disposition:\r\nExtended Care\r\n \r\nFacility:\r\n___\r\n \r\nDischarge Diagnosis:\r\nPrimary: Seizure, atypical meningioma, atrial fibrillation \r\n \r\nSecondary: Alzheimer's dementia, hepatitis C virus infection, \r\nhypertension, autoimmune hepatitis \r\n\r\n \r\nDischarge Condition:\r\nMental Status: Confused - always.\r\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.\r\nActivity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker \r\nor cane).\r\n\r\n \r\nDischarge Instructions:\r\nDear Ms. ___,\r\n\r\nIt was our pleasure caring for you at ___ \r\n___.  You were admitted to the hospital after having \r\nwhat was most likely a seizure.  We did a scan of your head and \r\nfound a benign tumor called an atypical meningioma.  This may \r\nincrease your risk for seizure, so we are starting you on an \r\nantiseizure medication called Keppra, which you will continue to \r\ntake twice daily.  This benign tumor does not require any \r\nsurgery to remove or chemotherapy.\r\n\r\nWhile you were here, you also had evidence of a fast, abnormal \r\nheart rhythm called atrial fibrillation.  This can increase the \r\nrisk of stroke; however, the risks of giving you a blood thinner \r\nto decrease the risk of stroke probably outweigh the benefits, \r\nso in discussion with your neurologists, we opted not to start \r\nyou on anticoagulation.  Your neurologist can re-evaluate this \r\ndecision as an outpatient in case you or your neice would like \r\nto revisit this issue.\r\n\r\nThank you for allowing us to participate in your care.\r\n \r\nFollowup Instructions:\r\n___\r\n"

Given the \r\nrapid growth in size am prominent peripheral FLAIR hyperintense \r\nsignal, this could represent an atypical meningioma. \r\n2. The lesion abuts the superior sagittal sinus without evidence \r\nof invasion. \r\n3. No additional lesions are identified. \r\n\r\nECG ___:  TRACING #4\r\nSinus arrhythmia. Compared to tracing #3 atrial and ventricular \r\npremature \r\nbeats are now not seen.

No evidence of infection as \r\npredisposing factor.  Patient was not orthostatic after 2L IVF.  \r\nShe did not have further syncopal or presyncopal symptoms.  MRI \r\nbrain was performed that revealed a 3 cm mass in the \r\ninterhemispheric fissue with characteristics suggestive of an \r\natypical meningioma.  ___ discussed with niece; patient would \r\nnot want surgical intervention.  She was started Keppra 500 mg \r\nPO BID for seizure prophylaxis and discharged with outpatient \r\nneuro follow-up. \r\n\r\n# A. fib: \r\nParoxysmal, newly discovered in ED on this admission. CHADSVASC \r\nscore 4, so anticoagulation would be warranted; however, \r\ndecision was made not to anticoagulate given age, risk of fall, \r\nand intracranial lesion.  Location makes saggital sinus \r\nvulnerable to compression, increasing risk for venous bleed.  \r\nNiece in agreement with decision.\r\n\r\n# Fever, leukocytosis: \r\nPatient with new T 101 and WBC count of 12 on admission, \r\nresolved today.  Infectious ROS entirely negative, and lab work \r\nup unrevealing (UA clear, LFTs NWL, CXR clear).  It is possible \r\nthat she aspirated during her syncopal event.\r\n\r\n# ___: \r\nCr 1.3 on admission, returned to her baseline of 0.9 with \r\nhydration.  Most likely prerenal given presence of hyaline casts \r\nand resolution with IVF.\r\n\r\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\r\n===============\r\n\r\n# Autoimmune hepatitis  \r\nThe patient was continued on her home prednisone  \r\n\r\n# Hypertension  \r\nThe patient was continued on her home nifedipine  \r\n\r\n# Alzheimer's dementia\r\nThe patient's mental status remained at her baseline throughout \r\nthis hospitalization.  She was Continued on her home donepezil \r\nand memantine.  \r\n\r\n# CODE STATUS: DNR, DNI (confirmed)\r\n# CONTACT:  ___ ___\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n====================\r\n- Patient with a ~3 cm mass arising from the intrahemispheric \r\nfissue with imaging appearance consistent with an atypical \r\nmeningioma. In goals of care discussion with the patient's \r\nniece, surgical management was deferred. She was started on \r\nKeppra 500 mg PO BID for seizure prophylaxis and will follow-up \r\nwith her neurologist as an outpatient\r\n- Patient diagnosed with new atrial fibrillation on this \r\nadmission. She did not require any standing nodal agents for \r\nrate control. Regarding anticoagulation, it would be indicated \r\ngiven her high CHADS2-VASC score; however, given the location of \r\nher atypical meningioma, advanced dementia, and limited life \r\nexpectancy, anticoagulation was deferred. She was continued on \r\nher home aspirin 81 mg PO QD.\r\n- If she has uncontrolled heart rates in the future, consider \r\nstarting a low-dose long-acting beta blocker, such as Metoprolol \r\nsuccinate 12.5-25 mg PO QD.\r\n \r\nMedications on Admission:\r\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\r\n1. PredniSONE 5 mg PO DAILY \r\n2. Memantine 21 mg PO DAILY \r\n3. NIFEdipine CR 30 mg PO DAILY \r\n4. Multivitamins W/minerals 1 TAB PO DAILY \r\n5. Donepezil 10 mg PO QHS \r\n6. Aspirin 81 mg PO DAILY \r\n7. Vitamin E 400 UNIT PO DAILY \r\n\r\n \r\nDischarge Medications:\r\n1. Aspirin 81 mg PO DAILY \r\n2. Donepezil 10 mg PO QHS \r\n3. Memantine 21 mg PO DAILY \r\n4. Multivitamins W/minerals 1 TAB PO DAILY \r\n5. NIFEdipine CR 30 mg PO DAILY \r\n6. PredniSONE 5 mg PO DAILY \r\n7. Vitamin E 400 UNIT PO DAILY \r\n8. LeVETiracetam 500 mg PO BID \r\n\r\n \r\nDischarge Disposition:\r\nExtended Care\r\n \r\nFacility:\r\n___\r\n \r\nDischarge Diagnosis:\r\nPrimary: Seizure, atypical meningioma, atrial fibrillation \r\n \r\nSecondary: Alzheimer's dementia, hepatitis C virus infection, \r\nhypertension, autoimmune hepatitis \r\n\r\n \r\nDischarge Condition:\r\nMental Status: Confused - always.\r\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.\r\nActivity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker \r\nor cane).\r\n\r\n \r\nDischarge Instructions:\r\nDear Ms. ___,\r\n\r\nIt was our pleasure caring for you at ___ \r\n___.  You were admitted to the hospital after having \r\nwhat was most likely a seizure.  We did a scan of your head and \r\nfound a benign tumor called an atypical meningioma.  This may \r\nincrease your risk for seizure, so we are starting you on an \r\nantiseizure medication called Keppra, which you will continue to \r\ntake twice daily.  This benign tumor does not require any \r\nsurgery to remove or chemotherapy.\r\n\r\nWhile you were here, you also had evidence of a fast, abnormal \r\nheart rhythm called atrial fibrillation.  This can increase the \r\nrisk of stroke; however, the risks of giving you a blood thinner \r\nto decrease the risk of stroke probably outweigh the benefits, \r\nso in discussion with your neurologists, we opted not to start \r\nyou on anticoagulation.  Your neurologist can re-evaluate this \r\ndecision as an outpatient in case you or your neice would like \r\nto revisit this issue.\r\n\r\nThank you for allowing us to participate in your care.\r\n \r\nFollowup Instructions:\r\n___\r\n"

No evidence of infection as \r\npredisposing factor.  Patient was not orthostatic after 2L IVF.  \r\nShe did not have further syncopal or presyncopal symptoms.  MRI \r\nbrain was performed that revealed a 3 cm mass in the \r\ninterhemispheric fissue with characteristics suggestive of an \r\natypical meningioma.  ___ discussed with niece; patient would \r\nnot want surgical intervention.  She was started Keppra 500 mg \r\nPO BID for seizure prophylaxis and discharged with outpatient \r\nneuro follow-up. \r\n\r\n# A. fib: \r\nParoxysmal, newly discovered in ED on this admission. CHADSVASC \r\nscore 4, so anticoagulation would be warranted; however, \r\ndecision was made not to anticoagulate given age, risk of fall, \r\nand intracranial lesion.  Location makes saggital sinus \r\nvulnerable to compression, increasing risk for venous bleed.  \r\nNiece in agreement with decision.\r\n\r\n# Fever, leukocytosis: \r\nPatient with new T 101 and WBC count of 12 on admission, \r\nresolved today.  Infectious ROS entirely negative, and lab work \r\nup unrevealing (UA clear, LFTs NWL, CXR clear).  It is possible \r\nthat she aspirated during her syncopal event.\r\n\r\n# ___: \r\nCr 1.3 on admission, returned to her baseline of 0.9 with \r\nhydration.  Most likely prerenal given presence of hyaline casts \r\nand resolution with IVF.\r\n\r\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\r\n===============\r\n\r\n# Autoimmune hepatitis  \r\nThe patient was continued on her home prednisone  \r\n\r\n# Hypertension  \r\nThe patient was continued on her home nifedipine  \r\n\r\n# Alzheimer's dementia\r\nThe patient's mental status remained at her baseline throughout \r\nthis hospitalization.  She was Continued on her home donepezil \r\nand memantine.  \r\n\r\n# CODE STATUS: DNR, DNI (confirmed)\r\n# CONTACT:  ___ ___\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n====================\r\n- Patient with a ~3 cm mass arising from the intrahemispheric \r\nfissue with imaging appearance consistent with an atypical \r\nmeningioma. In goals of care discussion with the patient's \r\nniece, surgical management was deferred. She was started on \r\nKeppra 500 mg PO BID for seizure prophylaxis and will follow-up \r\nwith her neurologist as an outpatient\r\n- Patient diagnosed with new atrial fibrillation on this \r\nadmission. She did not require any standing nodal agents for \r\nrate control. Regarding anticoagulation, it would be indicated \r\ngiven her high CHADS2-VASC score; however, given the location of \r\nher atypical meningioma, advanced dementia, and limited life \r\nexpectancy, anticoagulation was deferred. She was continued on \r\nher home aspirin 81 mg PO QD.\r\n- If she has uncontrolled heart rates in the future, consider \r\nstarting a low-dose long-acting beta blocker, such as Metoprolol \r\nsuccinate 12.5-25 mg PO QD.\r\n \r\nMedications on Admission:\r\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\r\n1. PredniSONE 5 mg PO DAILY \r\n2. Memantine 21 mg PO DAILY \r\n3. NIFEdipine CR 30 mg PO DAILY \r\n4. Multivitamins W/minerals 1 TAB PO DAILY \r\n5. Donepezil 10 mg PO QHS \r\n6. Aspirin 81 mg PO DAILY \r\n7. Vitamin E 400 UNIT PO DAILY \r\n\r\n \r\nDischarge Medications:\r\n1. Aspirin 81 mg PO DAILY \r\n2. Donepezil 10 mg PO QHS \r\n3. Memantine 21 mg PO DAILY \r\n4. Multivitamins W/minerals 1 TAB PO DAILY \r\n5. NIFEdipine CR 30 mg PO DAILY \r\n6. PredniSONE 5 mg PO DAILY \r\n7. Vitamin E 400 UNIT PO DAILY \r\n8. LeVETiracetam 500 mg PO BID \r\n\r\n \r\nDischarge Disposition:\r\nExtended Care\r\n \r\nFacility:\r\n___\r\n \r\nDischarge Diagnosis:\r\nPrimary: Seizure, atypical meningioma, atrial fibrillation \r\n \r\nSecondary: Alzheimer's dementia, hepatitis C virus infection, \r\nhypertension, autoimmune hepatitis \r\n\r\n \r\nDischarge Condition:\r\nMental Status: Confused - always.\r\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.\r\nActivity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker \r\nor cane).\r\n\r\n \r\nDischarge Instructions:\r\nDear Ms. ___,\r\n\r\nIt was our pleasure caring for you at ___ \r\n___.  You were admitted to the hospital after having \r\nwhat was most likely a seizure.  We did a scan of your head and \r\nfound a benign tumor called an atypical meningioma.  This may \r\nincrease your risk for seizure, so we are starting you on an \r\nantiseizure medication called Keppra, which you will continue to \r\ntake twice daily.  This benign tumor does not require any \r\nsurgery to remove or chemotherapy.\r\n\r\nWhile you were here, you also had evidence of a fast, abnormal \r\nheart rhythm called atrial fibrillation.  This can increase the \r\nrisk of stroke; however, the risks of giving you a blood thinner \r\nto decrease the risk of stroke probably outweigh the benefits, \r\nso in discussion with your neurologists, we opted not to start \r\nyou on anticoagulation.  Your neurologist can re-evaluate this \r\ndecision as an outpatient in case you or your neice would like \r\nto revisit this issue.\r\n\r\nThank you for allowing us to participate in your care.\r\n \r\nFollowup Instructions:\r\n___\r\n"

No evidence of infection as \r\npredisposing factor.  Patient was not orthostatic after 2L IVF.  \r\nShe did not have further syncopal or presyncopal symptoms.  MRI \r\nbrain was performed that revealed a 3 cm mass in the \r\ninterhemispheric fissue with characteristics suggestive of an \r\natypical meningioma.  ___ discussed with niece; patient would \r\nnot want surgical intervention.  She was started Keppra 500 mg \r\nPO BID for seizure prophylaxis and discharged with outpatient \r\nneuro follow-up. \r\n\r\n# A. fib: \r\nParoxysmal, newly discovered in ED on this admission. CHADSVASC \r\nscore 4, so anticoagulation would be warranted; however, \r\ndecision was made not to anticoagulate given age, risk of fall, \r\nand intracranial lesion.  Location makes saggital sinus \r\nvulnerable to compression, increasing risk for venous bleed.  \r\nNiece in agreement with decision.\r\n\r\n# Fever, leukocytosis: \r\nPatient with new T 101 and WBC count of 12 on admission, \r\nresolved today.  Infectious ROS entirely negative, and lab work \r\nup unrevealing (UA clear, LFTs NWL, CXR clear).  It is possible \r\nthat she aspirated during her syncopal event.\r\n\r\n# ___: \r\nCr 1.3 on admission, returned to her baseline of 0.9 with \r\nhydration.  Most likely prerenal given presence of hyaline casts \r\nand resolution with IVF.\r\n\r\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\r\n===============\r\n\r\n# Autoimmune hepatitis  \r\nThe patient was continued on her home prednisone  \r\n\r\n# Hypertension  \r\nThe patient was continued on her home nifedipine  \r\n\r\n# Alzheimer's dementia\r\nThe patient's mental status remained at her baseline throughout \r\nthis hospitalization.  She was Continued on her home donepezil \r\nand memantine.  \r\n\r\n# CODE STATUS: DNR, DNI (confirmed)\r\n# CONTACT:  ___ ___\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n====================\r\n- Patient with a ~3 cm mass arising from the intrahemispheric \r\nfissue with imaging appearance consistent with an atypical \r\nmeningioma. In goals of care discussion with the patient's \r\nniece, surgical management was deferred. She was started on \r\nKeppra 500 mg PO BID for seizure prophylaxis and will follow-up \r\nwith her neurologist as an outpatient\r\n- Patient diagnosed with new atrial fibrillation on this \r\nadmission. She did not require any standing nodal agents for \r\nrate control. Regarding anticoagulation, it would be indicated \r\ngiven her high CHADS2-VASC score; however, given the location of \r\nher atypical meningioma, advanced dementia, and limited life \r\nexpectancy, anticoagulation was deferred. She was continued on \r\nher home aspirin 81 mg PO QD.\r\n- If she has uncontrolled heart rates in the future, consider \r\nstarting a low-dose long-acting beta blocker, such as Metoprolol \r\nsuccinate 12.5-25 mg PO QD.\r\n \r\nMedications on Admission:\r\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\r\n1. PredniSONE 5 mg PO DAILY \r\n2. Memantine 21 mg PO DAILY \r\n3. NIFEdipine CR 30 mg PO DAILY \r\n4. Multivitamins W/minerals 1 TAB PO DAILY \r\n5. Donepezil 10 mg PO QHS \r\n6. Aspirin 81 mg PO DAILY \r\n7. Vitamin E 400 UNIT PO DAILY \r\n\r\n \r\nDischarge Medications:\r\n1. Aspirin 81 mg PO DAILY \r\n2. Donepezil 10 mg PO QHS \r\n3. Memantine 21 mg PO DAILY \r\n4.

LeVETiracetam 500 mg PO BID \r\n\r\n \r\nDischarge Disposition:\r\nExtended Care\r\n \r\nFacility:\r\n___\r\n \r\nDischarge Diagnosis:\r\nPrimary: Seizure, atypical meningioma, atrial fibrillation \r\n \r\nSecondary: Alzheimer's dementia, hepatitis C virus infection, \r\nhypertension, autoimmune hepatitis \r\n\r\n \r\nDischarge Condition:\r\nMental Status: Confused - always.\r\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.\r\nActivity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker \r\nor cane).\r\n\r\n \r\nDischarge Instructions:\r\nDear Ms. ___,\r\n\r\nIt was our pleasure caring for you at ___ \r\n___.  You were admitted to the hospital after having \r\nwhat was most likely a seizure.  We did a scan of your head and \r\nfound a benign tumor called an atypical meningioma.  This may \r\nincrease your risk for seizure, so we are starting you on an \r\nantiseizure medication called Keppra, which you will continue to \r\ntake twice daily.  This benign tumor does not require any \r\nsurgery to remove or chemotherapy.\r\n\r\nWhile you were here, you also had evidence of a fast, abnormal \r\nheart rhythm called atrial fibrillation.  This can increase the \r\nrisk of stroke; however, the risks of giving you a blood thinner \r\nto decrease the risk of stroke probably outweigh the benefits, \r\nso in discussion with your neurologists, we opted not to start \r\nyou on anticoagulation.  Your neurologist can re-evaluate this \r\ndecision as an outpatient in case you or your neice would like \r\nto revisit this issue.\r\n\r\nThank you for allowing us to participate in your care.\r\n \r\nFollowup Instructions:\r\n___\r\n"

Significant interval increase size of an extra-axial frontal \r\nlobe \r\nparafalcine lesion, compatible with a meningioma.  Given the \r\nrapid growth in size am prominent peripheral FLAIR hyperintense \r\nsignal, this could represent an atypical meningioma. \r\n2. The lesion abuts the superior sagittal sinus without evidence \r\nof invasion. \r\n3. No additional lesions are identified. \r\n\r\nECG ___:  TRACING #4\r\nSinus arrhythmia. Compared to tracing #3 atrial and ventricular \r\npremature \r\nbeats are now not seen. T waves are probably improved. \r\nOtherwise, no change. \r\n\r\n  Intervals     Axes \r\nRate PR QRS QT QTc (___)    P QRS T \r\n76 186 96 422 450   63 -49 48 \r\n \r\nECG ___:  TRACING #3 \r\nSinus rhythm with atrial and ventricular premature beats. \r\nCompared to the \r\nprevious tracing of ___ the rate is now slower.

No evidence of infection as \r\npredisposing factor.  Patient was not orthostatic after 2L IVF.  \r\nShe did not have further syncopal or presyncopal symptoms.  MRI \r\nbrain was performed that revealed a 3 cm mass in the \r\ninterhemispheric fissue with characteristics suggestive of an \r\natypical meningioma.  ___ discussed with niece; patient would \r\nnot want surgical intervention.  She was started Keppra 500 mg \r\nPO BID for seizure prophylaxis and discharged with outpatient \r\nneuro follow-up. \r\n\r\n# A. fib: \r\nParoxysmal, newly discovered in ED on this admission. CHADSVASC \r\nscore 4, so anticoagulation would be warranted; however, \r\ndecision was made not to anticoagulate given age, risk of fall, \r\nand intracranial lesion.

Most likely prerenal given presence of hyaline casts \r\nand resolution with IVF.\r\n\r\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\r\n===============\r\n\r\n# Autoimmune hepatitis  \r\nThe patient was continued on her home prednisone  \r\n\r\n# Hypertension  \r\nThe patient was continued on her home nifedipine  \r\n\r\n# Alzheimer's dementia\r\nThe patient's mental status remained at her baseline throughout \r\nthis hospitalization.  She was Continued on her home donepezil \r\nand memantine.  \r\n\r\n# CODE STATUS: DNR, DNI (confirmed)\r\n# CONTACT:  ___ ___\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n====================\r\n- Patient with a ~3 cm mass arising from the intrahemispheric \r\nfissue with imaging appearance consistent with an atypical \r\nmeningioma. In goals of care discussion with the patient's \r\nniece, surgical management was deferred. She was started on \r\nKeppra 500 mg PO BID for seizure prophylaxis and will follow-up \r\nwith her neurologist as an outpatient\r\n- Patient diagnosed with new atrial fibrillation on this \r\nadmission. She did not require any standing nodal agents for \r\nrate control. Regarding anticoagulation, it would be indicated \r\ngiven her high CHADS2-VASC score; however, given the location of \r\nher atypical meningioma, advanced dementia, and limited life \r\nexpectancy, anticoagulation was deferred. She was continued on \r\nher home aspirin 81 mg PO QD.\r\n- If she has uncontrolled heart rates in the future, consider \r\nstarting a low-dose long-acting beta blocker, such as Metoprolol \r\nsuccinate 12.5-25 mg PO QD.\r\n \r\nMedications on Admission:\r\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\r\n1. PredniSONE 5 mg PO DAILY \r\n2. Memantine 21 mg PO DAILY \r\n3. NIFEdipine CR 30 mg PO DAILY \r\n4. Multivitamins W/minerals 1 TAB PO DAILY \r\n5. Donepezil 10 mg PO QHS \r\n6.

You were admitted to the hospital after having \r\nwhat was most likely a seizure.  We did a scan of your head and \r\nfound a benign tumor called an atypical meningioma.  This may \r\nincrease your risk for seizure, so we are starting you on an \r\nantiseizure medication called Keppra, which you will continue to \r\ntake twice daily.  This benign tumor does not require any \r\nsurgery to remove or chemotherapy.\r\n\r\nWhile you were here, you also had evidence of a fast, abnormal \r\nheart rhythm called atrial fibrillation.  This can increase the \r\nrisk of stroke; however, the risks of giving you a blood thinner \r\nto decrease the risk of stroke probably outweigh the benefits, \r\nso in discussion with your neurologists, we opted not to start \r\nyou on anticoagulation.  Your neurologist can re-evaluate this \r\ndecision as an outpatient in case you or your neice would like \r\nto revisit this issue.\r\n\r\nThank you for allowing us to participate in your care.\r\n \r\nFollowup Instructions:\r\n___\r\n"

No evidence of infection as \r\npredisposing factor.  Patient was not orthostatic after 2L IVF.  \r\nShe did not have further syncopal or presyncopal symptoms.  MRI \r\nbrain was performed that revealed a 3 cm mass in the \r\ninterhemispheric fissue with characteristics suggestive of an \r\natypical meningioma.  ___ discussed with niece; patient would \r\nnot want surgical intervention.  She was started Keppra 500 mg \r\nPO BID for seizure prophylaxis and discharged with outpatient \r\nneuro follow-up. \r\n\r\n# A. fib: \r\nParoxysmal, newly discovered in ED on this admission. CHADSVASC \r\nscore 4, so anticoagulation would be warranted; however, \r\ndecision was made not to anticoagulate given age, risk of fall, \r\nand intracranial lesion.  Location makes saggital sinus \r\nvulnerable to compression, increasing risk for venous bleed.  \r\nNiece in agreement with decision.\r\n\r\n# Fever, leukocytosis: \r\nPatient with new T 101 and WBC count of 12 on admission, \r\nresolved today.  Infectious ROS entirely negative, and lab work \r\nup unrevealing (UA clear, LFTs NWL, CXR clear).  It is possible \r\nthat she aspirated during her syncopal event.\r\n\r\n# ___: \r\nCr 1.3 on admission, returned to her baseline of 0.9 with \r\nhydration.  Most likely prerenal given presence of hyaline casts \r\nand resolution with IVF.\r\n\r\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\r\n===============\r\n\r\n# Autoimmune hepatitis  \r\nThe patient was continued on her home prednisone  \r\n\r\n# Hypertension  \r\nThe patient was continued on her home nifedipine  \r\n\r\n# Alzheimer's dementia\r\nThe patient's mental status remained at her baseline throughout \r\nthis hospitalization.

In goals of care discussion with the patient's \r\nniece, surgical management was deferred. She was started on \r\nKeppra 500 mg PO BID for seizure prophylaxis and will follow-up \r\nwith her neurologist as an outpatient\r\n- Patient diagnosed with new atrial fibrillation on this \r\nadmission. She did not require any standing nodal agents for \r\nrate control. Regarding anticoagulation, it would be indicated \r\ngiven her high CHADS2-VASC score; however, given the location of \r\nher atypical meningioma, advanced dementia, and limited life \r\nexpectancy, anticoagulation was deferred. She was continued on \r\nher home aspirin 81 mg PO QD.\r\n- If she has uncontrolled heart rates in the future, consider \r\nstarting a low-dose long-acting beta blocker, such as Metoprolol \r\nsuccinate 12.5-25 mg PO QD.\r\n \r\nMedications on Admission:\r\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\r\n1.

You were admitted to the hospital after having \r\nwhat was most likely a seizure.  We did a scan of your head and \r\nfound a benign tumor called an atypical meningioma.  This may \r\nincrease your risk for seizure, so we are starting you on an \r\nantiseizure medication called Keppra, which you will continue to \r\ntake twice daily.  This benign tumor does not require any \r\nsurgery to remove or chemotherapy.\r\n\r\nWhile you were here, you also had evidence of a fast, abnormal \r\nheart rhythm called atrial fibrillation.  This can increase the \r\nrisk of stroke; however, the risks of giving you a blood thinner \r\nto decrease the risk of stroke probably outweigh the benefits, \r\nso in discussion with your neurologists, we opted not to start \r\nyou on anticoagulation.  Your neurologist can re-evaluate this \r\ndecision as an outpatient in case you or your neice would like \r\nto revisit this issue.\r\n\r\nThank you for allowing us to participate in your care.\r\n \r\nFollowup Instructions:\r\n___\r\n"

She was continued on \r\nher home aspirin 81 mg PO QD.\r\n- If she has uncontrolled heart rates in the future, consider \r\nstarting a low-dose long-acting beta blocker, such as Metoprolol \r\nsuccinate 12.5-25 mg PO QD.\r\n \r\nMedications on Admission:\r\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\r\n1.

You were admitted to the hospital after having \r\nwhat was most likely a seizure.  We did a scan of your head and \r\nfound a benign tumor called an atypical meningioma.  This may \r\nincrease your risk for seizure, so we are starting you on an \r\nantiseizure medication called Keppra, which you will continue to \r\ntake twice daily.  This benign tumor does not require any \r\nsurgery to remove or chemotherapy.\r\n\r\nWhile you were here, you also had evidence of a fast, abnormal \r\nheart rhythm called atrial fibrillation.  This can increase the \r\nrisk of stroke; however, the risks of giving you a blood thinner \r\nto decrease the risk of stroke probably outweigh the benefits, \r\nso in discussion with your neurologists, we opted not to start \r\nyou on anticoagulation.  Your neurologist can re-evaluate this \r\ndecision as an outpatient in case you or your neice would like \r\nto revisit this issue.\r\n\r\nThank you for allowing us to participate in your care.\r\n \r\nFollowup Instructions:\r\n___\r\n"

In addition to change in mental status, she also \r\nhad ataxia with unbalance on feet. She did not have \r\nopthalmoplegia. Given the altered mental status and ataxia, she \r\nwas treated for Wernicke's Encephalopathy. She was given \r\nthiamine 500 mg IV TID for 3 days, followed by thiamine 500 mg \r\nIV daily until she left against medical advice on ___. Prior to \r\ndischarge recommendation was to take thiamine 100 mg PO daily. A \r\nCT of the head did show cerebellar atrophy which also likely \r\nplayed a role in her change in mental status.

Given the altered mental status and ataxia, she \r\nwas treated for Wernicke's Encephalopathy. She was given \r\nthiamine 500 mg IV TID for 3 days, followed by thiamine 500 mg \r\nIV daily until she left against medical advice on ___. Prior to \r\ndischarge recommendation was to take thiamine 100 mg PO daily. A \r\nCT of the head did show cerebellar atrophy which also likely \r\nplayed a role in her change in mental status. Vitamin B12 was \r\nfound to be low at 216, therefore she was given B12 IM 1000 mcg \r\ndaily was from ___. Recommendation for was vitamin B12 IM \r\n1000 mcg daily for 10 days and then vitamin B12 IM 1000 mcg \r\nweekly for ___ weeks, then vitamin B12 IM 1000 mcg monthly. \r\nSince the patient left AMA, she was given cyanocbolamin 1000 mcg \r\nPO daily.

According to family, she \r\nwas slow to respond to questions and had forgotten to do some of \r\nher daily activities. She has a history significant for chronic \r\nalcohol use. In addition to change in mental status, she also \r\nhad ataxia with unbalance on feet. She did not have \r\nopthalmoplegia. Given the altered mental status and ataxia, she \r\nwas treated for Wernicke's Encephalopathy. She was given \r\nthiamine 500 mg IV TID for 3 days, followed by thiamine 500 mg \r\nIV daily until she left against medical advice on ___. Prior to \r\ndischarge recommendation was to take thiamine 100 mg PO daily. A \r\nCT of the head did show cerebellar atrophy which also likely \r\nplayed a role in her change in mental status. Vitamin B12 was \r\nfound to be low at 216, therefore she was given B12 IM 1000 mcg \r\ndaily was from ___. Recommendation for was vitamin B12 IM \r\n1000 mcg daily for 10 days and then vitamin B12 IM 1000 mcg \r\nweekly for ___ weeks, then vitamin B12 IM 1000 mcg monthly. \r\nSince the patient left AMA, she was given cyanocbolamin 1000 mcg \r\nPO daily. Neurology was consulted. They believed the source of \r\nthe altered mental status likely was multifactorial including \r\nvitamin deficiencies of thiamine, B12, as well as chronic \r\nsequelae of alcohol use, recommended neurology f/u. With \r\nsupplementation with thiamine, vitamin B12, multivitamin and a \r\nbalanced diet, her altered mental status improved and she was \r\nnear baseline, however we advised that she stay in house for \r\nfurther rehabilitation given that she didn't pass ___ due to \r\ninstability and did not qualify for rehab.

The \r\ngout responded well to the naproxen. As she left AMA, we \r\nrecommended she continue the naproxen for 2 additional days \r\nafter the symptoms resolve. We also advised her to contact her \r\nPCP if the symptoms last more than one week.\r\n\r\n#HYPOTENSION: During hospitalization, Ms. ___ had systolic \r\nblood pressures ranging from the upper ___ to low 100s. She \r\nremained asymptomatic when her blood pressures were low. She did \r\nnot feel chest pressure, tightness, shortness of breath, or \r\nlightheadedness/dizziness when standing. Initial thought was \r\nthat it was due to poor nutrition/low volume satus. Fluid \r\nrepletion and improved diet did improve blood pressure into the \r\nhigh ___. Even after IVFs and improved nutrition blood pressure \r\nstill remained low.  An AM cortisol was obtained to assess \r\nadrenal function and was normal at 11.  She had no evidence of \r\ninfection and remained asymptomatic. \r\n\r\n#ANEMIA: Patient presented with a macrocytic anemia. This was \r\nlikely in the setting of chronic alcohol use as well as her \r\nprevious bariatic surgery. B12 was low as noted above. To \r\nreplete B12, we gave Vitamin B12 IM 1000 mcg daily. We also \r\nprovided folic acid even though folate was within normal limits \r\nat 8. H/H remained relatively stable during hospitalization and \r\nwas 8.8/29.2 at the time of discharge. She remained asymptomatic \r\nwith no lightheadedness, dizziness, sob, or chest pain.

You were initially evaluated with imaging of your \r\nhead (head CT) which showed atrophy (weakening) of the \r\ncerebellum (part of the brain). This was likely due to chronic \r\nalcohol use in the past. The ataxia and slowing of your thinking \r\nwas also likely due to the chronic alcohol use in the past. In \r\norder to help improve your thinking, we gave you a vitamin \r\ncalled thiamine which helped improve your thinking as well as \r\nyour balance.

According to family, she \r\nwas slow to respond to questions and had forgotten to do some of \r\nher daily activities. She has a history significant for chronic \r\nalcohol use. In addition to change in mental status, she also \r\nhad ataxia with unbalance on feet. She did not have \r\nopthalmoplegia. Given the altered mental status and ataxia, she \r\nwas treated for Wernicke's Encephalopathy. She was given \r\nthiamine 500 mg IV TID for 3 days, followed by thiamine 500 mg \r\nIV daily until she left against medical advice on ___. Prior to \r\ndischarge recommendation was to take thiamine 100 mg PO daily. A \r\nCT of the head did show cerebellar atrophy which also likely \r\nplayed a role in her change in mental status. Vitamin B12 was \r\nfound to be low at 216, therefore she was given B12 IM 1000 mcg \r\ndaily was from ___. Recommendation for was vitamin B12 IM \r\n1000 mcg daily for 10 days and then vitamin B12 IM 1000 mcg \r\nweekly for ___ weeks, then vitamin B12 IM 1000 mcg monthly. \r\nSince the patient left AMA, she was given cyanocbolamin 1000 mcg \r\nPO daily. Neurology was consulted. They believed the source of \r\nthe altered mental status likely was multifactorial including \r\nvitamin deficiencies of thiamine, B12, as well as chronic \r\nsequelae of alcohol use, recommended neurology f/u. With \r\nsupplementation with thiamine, vitamin B12, multivitamin and a \r\nbalanced diet, her altered mental status improved and she was \r\nnear baseline, however we advised that she stay in house for \r\nfurther rehabilitation given that she didn't pass ___ due to \r\ninstability and did not qualify for rehab.  She was advised of \r\nthe risks of discharge including further instability leading to \r\nfalls and at the extreme, death, however she elected to leave \r\nregardles.\r\n\r\n#GOUT: Ms. ___ has a history of gout. During hospitalization \r\nshe developed swelling, erythema, and warmth of the right ankle. \r\nThis was initially treated with naproxen 750 mg PO, followed by \r\n250 mg PO Q8H with meals for five days (day 1: ___. The \r\ngout responded well to the naproxen. As she left AMA, we \r\nrecommended she continue the naproxen for 2 additional days \r\nafter the symptoms resolve. We also advised her to contact her \r\nPCP if the symptoms last more than one week.\r\n\r\n#HYPOTENSION: During hospitalization, Ms. ___ had systolic \r\nblood pressures ranging from the upper ___ to low 100s. She \r\nremained asymptomatic when her blood pressures were low. She did \r\nnot feel chest pressure, tightness, shortness of breath, or \r\nlightheadedness/dizziness when standing. Initial thought was \r\nthat it was due to poor nutrition/low volume satus. Fluid \r\nrepletion and improved diet did improve blood pressure into the \r\nhigh ___. Even after IVFs and improved nutrition blood pressure \r\nstill remained low.  An AM cortisol was obtained to assess \r\nadrenal function and was normal at 11.  She had no evidence of \r\ninfection and remained asymptomatic. \r\n\r\n#ANEMIA: Patient presented with a macrocytic anemia. This was \r\nlikely in the setting of chronic alcohol use as well as her \r\nprevious bariatic surgery. B12 was low as noted above. To \r\nreplete B12, we gave Vitamin B12 IM 1000 mcg daily. We also \r\nprovided folic acid even though folate was within normal limits \r\nat 8. H/H remained relatively stable during hospitalization and \r\nwas 8.8/29.2 at the time of discharge. She remained asymptomatic \r\nwith no lightheadedness, dizziness, sob, or chest pain. She \r\nrequired no transfusions during hospitalization.     \r\n\r\n#ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE: Ms. ___ has a significant history of \r\nalcohol consumption.

The neurologists would also like to have you \r\nseen as an outpatient with a neurologist within the At___ \r\nnetwork. We also had social work come see you to discuss options \r\nregarding resources to help quit alcohol consumption.   We \r\nrecommended that you stay in the hospital given your ongoing \r\ndifficulty with standing and climbing stairs, and need for \r\nphysical therapy as well as ongoing IV thiamine.  You elected to \r\nleave against medical advice.  You were advised of the risks of \r\nleaving against medical advice, including falling with \r\npossibility of serious injury including death, worsening \r\nconfusion, poor pain control and worsening of gout.  You \r\nunderstood and accepted these risks and elected to leave against \r\nmedical advice regardless.\r\n\r\nWhile in the hospital, you were also treated for a gout flare.  \r\nYou should continue to take naproxen for 2 days after your \r\nsymptoms resolve and you should contact your PCP if your \r\nsymptoms last for more than a week.\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to continue taking these vitamins as they are \r\nhelping improve your symptoms.  \r\n\r\nIt was a pleasure taking care of you in the hospital!\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nYour ___ Care Team \r\n \r\nFollowup Instructions:\r\n___\r\n"

In addition to change in mental status, she also \r\nhad ataxia with unbalance on feet. She did not have \r\nopthalmoplegia. Given the altered mental status and ataxia, she \r\nwas treated for Wernicke's Encephalopathy. She was given \r\nthiamine 500 mg IV TID for 3 days, followed by thiamine 500 mg \r\nIV daily until she left against medical advice on ___. Prior to \r\ndischarge recommendation was to take thiamine 100 mg PO daily. A \r\nCT of the head did show cerebellar atrophy which also likely \r\nplayed a role in her change in mental status. Vitamin B12 was \r\nfound to be low at 216, therefore she was given B12 IM 1000 mcg \r\ndaily was from ___. Recommendation for was vitamin B12 IM \r\n1000 mcg daily for 10 days and then vitamin B12 IM 1000 mcg \r\nweekly for ___ weeks, then vitamin B12 IM 1000 mcg monthly. \r\nSince the patient left AMA, she was given cyanocbolamin 1000 mcg \r\nPO daily.

According to family, she \r\nwas slow to respond to questions and had forgotten to do some of \r\nher daily activities. She has a history significant for chronic \r\nalcohol use. In addition to change in mental status, she also \r\nhad ataxia with unbalance on feet. She did not have \r\nopthalmoplegia. Given the altered mental status and ataxia, she \r\nwas treated for Wernicke's Encephalopathy. She was given \r\nthiamine 500 mg IV TID for 3 days, followed by thiamine 500 mg \r\nIV daily until she left against medical advice on ___. Prior to \r\ndischarge recommendation was to take thiamine 100 mg PO daily. A \r\nCT of the head did show cerebellar atrophy which also likely \r\nplayed a role in her change in mental status. Vitamin B12 was \r\nfound to be low at 216, therefore she was given B12 IM 1000 mcg \r\ndaily was from ___. Recommendation for was vitamin B12 IM \r\n1000 mcg daily for 10 days and then vitamin B12 IM 1000 mcg \r\nweekly for ___ weeks, then vitamin B12 IM 1000 mcg monthly. \r\nSince the patient left AMA, she was given cyanocbolamin 1000 mcg \r\nPO daily. Neurology was consulted.

According to family, she \r\nwas slow to respond to questions and had forgotten to do some of \r\nher daily activities. She has a history significant for chronic \r\nalcohol use. In addition to change in mental status, she also \r\nhad ataxia with unbalance on feet. She did not have \r\nopthalmoplegia. Given the altered mental status and ataxia, she \r\nwas treated for Wernicke's Encephalopathy. She was given \r\nthiamine 500 mg IV TID for 3 days, followed by thiamine 500 mg \r\nIV daily until she left against medical advice on ___. Prior to \r\ndischarge recommendation was to take thiamine 100 mg PO daily. A \r\nCT of the head did show cerebellar atrophy which also likely \r\nplayed a role in her change in mental status. Vitamin B12 was \r\nfound to be low at 216, therefore she was given B12 IM 1000 mcg \r\ndaily was from ___. Recommendation for was vitamin B12 IM \r\n1000 mcg daily for 10 days and then vitamin B12 IM 1000 mcg \r\nweekly for ___ weeks, then vitamin B12 IM 1000 mcg monthly. \r\nSince the patient left AMA, she was given cyanocbolamin 1000 mcg \r\nPO daily. Neurology was consulted. They believed the source of \r\nthe altered mental status likely was multifactorial including \r\nvitamin deficiencies of thiamine, B12, as well as chronic \r\nsequelae of alcohol use, recommended neurology f/u. With \r\nsupplementation with thiamine, vitamin B12, multivitamin and a \r\nbalanced diet, her altered mental status improved and she was \r\nnear baseline, however we advised that she stay in house for \r\nfurther rehabilitation given that she didn't pass ___ due to \r\ninstability and did not qualify for rehab.

She \r\nremained asymptomatic when her blood pressures were low. She did \r\nnot feel chest pressure, tightness, shortness of breath, or \r\nlightheadedness/dizziness when standing. Initial thought was \r\nthat it was due to poor nutrition/low volume satus. Fluid \r\nrepletion and improved diet did improve blood pressure into the \r\nhigh ___. Even after IVFs and improved nutrition blood pressure \r\nstill remained low.  An AM cortisol was obtained to assess \r\nadrenal function and was normal at 11.  She had no evidence of \r\ninfection and remained asymptomatic. \r\n\r\n#ANEMIA: Patient presented with a macrocytic anemia. This was \r\nlikely in the setting of chronic alcohol use as well as her \r\nprevious bariatic surgery. B12 was low as noted above. To \r\nreplete B12, we gave Vitamin B12 IM 1000 mcg daily. We also \r\nprovided folic acid even though folate was within normal limits \r\nat 8. H/H remained relatively stable during hospitalization and \r\nwas 8.8/29.2 at the time of discharge.

The mediastinal and hilar contours are \r\nnormal. The \r\npulmonary vasculature is normal. Lungs are clear.  No pleural \r\neffusion or \r\npneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  \r\nChain sutures are noted in the left upper quadrant of the \r\nabdomen. \r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\nNo acute cardiopulmonary abnormality \r\n\r\n___ CT abd/pelvis:\r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\n1. No active extravasation of contrast to suggest active GI \r\nbleeding at this time. \r\n2. Profound hepatic steatosis.  Enlarged periportal lymph nodes \r\nwith hazy \r\nmesentery and retroperitoneum likely reflect underlying liver \r\ndisease. \r\n3.  Colonic and rectal wall thickening which may reflect colitis \r\nversus portal colopathy.\r\n4. Heterogeneous appearance of the kidneys with possible \r\nstriated nephrograms. Correlate with urinalysis to exclude \r\npyelonephritis. \r\n\r\n___ TTE:\r\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are \r\nnormal (LVEF = 65%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal \r\nleft ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right \r\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The \r\ndiameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are \r\nnormal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal \r\nwith good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic \r\nregurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. \r\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly myxomatous. Frank mitral \r\nvalve prolapse is not seen but cannot be excluded with \r\ncertainty. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate \r\n(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature \r\nof the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly \r\nunderestimated (Coanda effect). There is borderline pulmonary \r\nartery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.  \r\n\r\n\r\n___ ___\r\nIMPRESSION:   \r\n1. Occlusive thrombus of all right lower extremity deep veins \r\nfrom the common femoral vein down to the calf veins. \r\n2. Patent left lower extremity veins. \r\n\r\n___ ECHO\r\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is \r\nnormal. LV systolic function appears depressed (LVEF = 40%) \r\nsecondary to hypokinesis of the basal two-thirds of the left \r\nventricle. The apical one-third of the left ventricle is \r\nhyperdynamic. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall \r\nmotion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, \r\nascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets \r\n(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No \r\naortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are \r\nmildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic \r\npressure is normal. The pulmonary artery is not well visualized. \r\nThere is no pericardial effusion. \r\n Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \r\nleft ventricular systolic dysfunction is now present. Findings \r\nsuggestive of stress cardiomyopathy with inverse Takotsubo \r\npattern of left ventricular contractile dysfunction.  \r\n\r\n___ CTH:\r\nIMPRESSION: \r\n1. There is mild progression of global cerebral atrophy since \r\nthe prior \r\nexamination of ___, greater than would be expected \r\nfor the \r\npatient's age. \r\n2. No intracranial hemorrhage or territorial infarct. \r\n\r\n___ LIVER US:\r\nIMPRESSION:    \r\n1.  Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of \r\nliver disease including steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, or \r\ncirrhosis cannot be excluded on the basis of this examination. \r\n2.  Trace ascites and small right pleural effusion. \r\n\r\n___ IVC filter placement:\r\nFINDINGS:   \r\n1. Patent normal sized, non-duplicated IVC with  no evidence of \r\na IVC \r\nthrombus. A small circumaortic renal vein originating from the \r\nIVC just above the bifurcation was noted however is very small \r\nin caliber and likely of no clinical significance. \r\n2. Successful deployment of an infra-renal retrievable IVC \r\nfilter. \r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\nSuccessful deployment of an infra-renal removable IVC filter. \r\n\r\n___ ECHO:\r\nConclusions   \r\n The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left \r\nventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular \r\nsystolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). Right ventricular \r\nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve \r\nleaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet \r\nexcursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The \r\nmitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral \r\nregurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary \r\nartery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a \r\ntrivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. \r\n IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved \r\nregional and low normal global biventricular systolic function. \r\nNo valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified. Trivial \r\npericardial effusion. \r\n\r\n___ Unilateral RLE veins \r\nIMPRESSION:    \r\nExtensive deep venous thrombosis involving the wall of the right \r\nlower \r\nextremity veins, overall similar to ___, but now with \r\nperhaps minimal flow in the distal right SFV. \r\n\r\n___ Video oropharyngeal swallow study\r\nAspiration with thin liquid consistency.\r\n\r\n___ Portable abdomen x-ray\r\nPatient is post gastric bypass surgery.  The Dobbhoff tube ends \r\nin the \r\nproximal jejunum. \r\n\r\n___ Renal ultrasound\r\nNo evidence of hydronephrosis.  Increased renal echogenicity \r\nconsistent with diffuse parenchymal renal disease.   \r\nSmall bilateral effusions and small to moderate volume ascites. \r\n\r\n___ - EGD\r\nDuodenum was not examined. Small gastric pouch consistent with \r\nRoux en y anatomy the blind limb and jejunal limb were both \r\nvisualized. No varices. Otherwise normal EGD to the jejunum.\r\n\r\n \r\nBrief Hospital Course:\r\n___ hx gastric bypass surgery, alcohol abuse complicated by \r\nWernicke's encephalopathy, concern for autonomic insufficiency, \r\npresented originally with hypotension, anemia and academia. Her \r\ncourse in the MICU was complicated by severe nutritional \r\ndeficiency, volume overload, renal failure, cardiomyopathy, \r\nhypoxemia and hypoxemic respiratory failure, and deep vein \r\nthrombosis.\r\n\r\n# Hypotension:\r\n# Cardiomyopathy: \r\n# Presumed alcoholic liver disease:\r\nPatient was given 4u PRBCs in the ED prior to FICU admission; \r\nher Hgb was stable for days afterward, and there was low \r\nsuspicion for active GIB initially in her MICU course. She was \r\nempirically antiobiosed for concern of sepsis, but no source was \r\nfound, and these antibiotics were held until a series of \r\npresumed aspiration events that will be discussed below. Morning \r\ncortisol was within normal limits twice; TSH was also within \r\nnormal limits. She underwent several echocardiograms to explain \r\nher persistent hypotension with pressor requirement that showed \r\nin sequence: mitral regurgitation with eccentric jet; inverse \r\nTakutsubo's cardiomyopathy; and then resolution of these issues. \r\nOf note, the resolution occurred after initiation of high-dose \r\nthiamine repletion, which may suggest an element of wet \r\nberiberbi from severe nutritional deficiency in the setting of \r\ngastric bypass and alcoholism. There was also strong suspicion \r\nof cirrhosis given her imaging and alcohol abuse history, for \r\nwhich she was started on midodrine. With these measures, she was \r\nsuccessfully weaned from pressors. Unresolved at the time of her \r\nMICU discharge was a question of autonomic insufficiency raised \r\nin her last Discharge Summary of ___ where it was thought her \r\nalcohol abuse could be contributing to baseline systolic \r\npressures in the ___. This in part resolved on the floor as the \r\npatient was weaned off midodrine and maintained systolic blood \r\npressure in the 100s.\r\n\r\n# Anemia: \r\n-Unexplained, possible GI source with lack of erythropoietin in \r\nthe setting of subacute renal failure . Patient had decreasing \r\npRBC transfusion requirements over the course of her stay, \r\nultimately needing 1U pRBC every 4 days. She was evaluated by \r\nHem/Onc who felt there was no evidence of significant hemolysis \r\nor malignancy and felt that there was an element of anemia of \r\nchronic inflammation, as well as decreased erythropoietin in the \r\nsetting of subacute renal failure. She was evaluated by GI who \r\nfound no source of bleed on sigmoidoscopy early in her course \r\nand no varices or bleeding on EGD. She had an episode of guaiac \r\npositive stool but had no significant bleeding on colonoscopy. \r\nPatient may benefit from outpatient capsule study if bleeding is \r\nongoing.\r\n\r\n# Thrombocytopenia: \r\nThere was no evidence of active bleed on presentation (stool \r\nnormal color, not tachycardic, no clinical or radiographic \r\nevidence of extravasation into a compartment). Surgery and GI \r\nwere consulted early in her MICU course for concern of ischemic \r\ngut in the setting of rising lactate, but flexible sigmoidoscopy \r\nwas negative for this and lactate resolved with fluid \r\nresuscitation. ___ Hematology consulted, and believe her \r\nanemia and thrombocytopenia are likely a combination of \r\nalcoholic bone marrow suppression, malnutrition and critical \r\nillness. She may benefit from a bone marrow biopsy when more \r\nstable; additionally, given her renal failure, she may have a \r\ndeveloping EPO deficiency. She was transfused by ED prior to \r\nMICU admission and did not require further blood products until \r\n___ (gradually dropping Hct attributed to anemia of chronic \r\nillness/inflammation/underproduction; she held her Hct each time \r\nafter transfusion).  \r\n\r\n# Diarrhea:\r\nNegative c. diff, improved over the course of the hospital stay. \r\nPossibly related to tube feeding formulas as this improved with \r\nchanging to a higher fiber formula and with the addition of \r\nbanana flakes. Recommend continued loperamide as needed and \r\noptimization of tube feeds in patient s/p gastric bypass.\r\n\r\n# Renal Failure (Addressed Separately Below):\r\nPresented with serum bicarbonate of 8 of unclear etiology. She \r\nmanifested diarrhea in the early part of her ICU stay (C diff \r\nassay negative, thought related to either alcohol abuse or early \r\ncourse of antibiotics administered empirically for presumed \r\nsepsis, resolved); her renal function markers may also have been \r\nunder-estimates of her true GFR given her nutritionally \r\ndeficient state. Acidemia corrected with bicarbonate drip, but \r\nrecurrence remains in a concern in the setting of her renal \r\nfailure with poor UOP. CRRT was started in the setting of volume \r\noverload in the ICU as described above, though she was noted to \r\nhave ATN by muddy brown casts in her urine as well as \r\npersistently poor UOP. At time of FICU discharge she is being \r\ntrialed off CRRT, though with her poor UOP she may need to be \r\ninitiated on standing dialysis. Upon transfer to the floor, her \r\nrenal function did not improve and she remained oliguric. She \r\nwas evaluated by nephrology who felt that ATN without renal \r\nrecovery was the most likely diagnosis based on her urine \r\nsediment and history. A renal biopsy was considered, but \r\nnephrology felt that the risks of the biopsy on a patient \r\nalready requiring heparin for DVT would outweigh the benefits \r\nwith the suspicion of ATN being high already. Urine output \r\nremained low prior to discharge, and tunneled HD line was placed \r\nfor longer-term access.\r\n\r\n# Respiratory Failure:\r\nPatient developed progressive hypoxemia from volume overload \r\neventually requiring CRRT with resolution of the same. However, \r\non ___ she had an unexplained hypoxemic respiratory episode \r\nwith persistent SpO2 measurements in the ___ despite NRB and NC; \r\nshe was intubated with ___ of continued O2 saturations in \r\nthe ___ before resolution not attributable to any particular \r\nintervention (nebs, suction, etc). This first hypoxemic episode \r\nwas attributed to aspiration though subsequent CXR and \r\nbronchoscopy were not impressive for evidence of the same. She \r\nwas extubated within 24hrs, but then reintubated in the setting \r\nof a break in her CRRT line that caused acute hypotension from \r\nblood loss (trapped in the CRRT circuit) and then hypoxemia. \r\nAfter restoration of hemodynamic stability and passing her RSBI, \r\nshe was again extubated, but re-intubated for nearly the same \r\nexact sequence of events that evening(break in the CRRT circuit \r\ndue to equipment failure; this has been reported and is being \r\ninvestigated). She was finally extubated on ___ and remains \r\noff supplemental O2 at time of MICU discharge. Antibiotics were \r\nempirically started in the setting of possible aspiration with \r\nleukocytosis (that could have been a stress reaction to \r\naspiration pneumonitis or intubations/exbuations); these will \r\nfinish on ___. She completed her course of antibiotics and \r\nremained afebrile and without respiratory distress the rest of \r\nher hospitalization. \r\n\r\n# Alcohol Abuse:\r\nPatient endorses heavy alcohol use. She was seen by social work \r\nwho gave resources, though patient is not interested in \r\ncounseling.\r\n\r\n# Severe Nutritional Deficiency:\r\nNutritional deficiencies including zinc and selenium requiring \r\nsignificant repletion. Repeat testing of zinc showed continued \r\nneed for repletion. Caloric needs and repletion addressed below.\r\n\r\n# Severe malnutrition: likely contributor to pancytopenia \r\nresulting from bone marrow suppression. Required tube feeding \r\ntube feed which was continued at discharge in order to meet her \r\ncaloric needs. She was initially found to aspirate thin liquids \r\nby a speech and swallow evaluation, however on reevaluation \r\nafter receiving tube feeds for some time, she was able to \r\ntolerate a regular diet and thin liquids. Her caloric intake by \r\nmouth was not sufficient to decrease tube feeds.\r\n\r\n# Hx Wernicke's Encephalopathy:\r\nPatient had waxing/waning mental status for much of her early \r\nhospital course which was initially attributed to delirium; \r\nhowever, for history of Wernicke's she was started on high-dose \r\nthiamine that seemed to improve her mental status. Nutrition was \r\nconsulted, and nutrition labs were sent that were all markedly \r\nlow. She was supplemented through her TFs and will need to \r\nremain on standing thiamine.\r\n\r\n# Deep Vein Thrombosis:\r\nPatient arrived to MICU with L femoral CVL; shortly thereafter, \r\nasymmetric R > L lower extremity swelling was noticed for which \r\n___ was obtained - this showed extensive venous clot burden in \r\nthe R lower extremity. IV heparin was started. Because of \r\npersistent thrombocytopenia, an IVC filter was placed, though \r\nbecause of her high clot risk IV heparin was continued. She \r\nshould have interval follow-up of her DVTs after discharge, as \r\nwell as scheduled follow-up with ___ for filter removal. She was \r\nmaintained on a heparin drip and should be bridged to Coumadin \r\nto follow up with hematology/oncology as an outpatient.\r\n \r\n# Concern for Gastrointestinal Bleed:\r\nAs described above, GI and Surgery were consulted early in her \r\nMICU stay for rising lactate and concern of gut ischemia in the \r\nsetting of her hypotension; flexible sigmoidoscopy was \r\nunimpressive and lactate improved with pressors and IVF. Near \r\nthe end of her FICU stay she had fresh blood coating a stool \r\nwhich raised concern for GIB; however, her Hct was stable, she \r\nwas HD stable, and guaiacs of subsequent stools were negative \r\nprior to MICU discharge. She underwent evaluation by Hepatology \r\nand EGD which showed no varices, negative colonoscopy. Capsule \r\nstudy failed, but patient's H/H stabilized and hepatology felt \r\nthe study could be done as an outpatient if necessary.\r\n\r\n**Transitional:**\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n-Patient will need daily assessment for hemodialysis needs, EPO \r\nwith HD given renal failure\r\n-Reassess nutritional status and continued need for tube \r\nfeeding, potential need for G-tube\r\n-Daily electrolytes and every other day CBC to evaluate need for \r\nblood transfusion\r\n-Patient on heparin gtt for DVT. Recommend bridge to coumadin\r\n-Needs appointment with OBGYN for Mirena IUD removal.

The mediastinal and hilar contours are \r\nnormal. The \r\npulmonary vasculature is normal. Lungs are clear.  No pleural \r\neffusion or \r\npneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  \r\nChain sutures are noted in the left upper quadrant of the \r\nabdomen. \r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\nNo acute cardiopulmonary abnormality \r\n\r\n___ CT abd/pelvis:\r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\n1. No active extravasation of contrast to suggest active GI \r\nbleeding at this time. \r\n2. Profound hepatic steatosis.  Enlarged periportal lymph nodes \r\nwith hazy \r\nmesentery and retroperitoneum likely reflect underlying liver \r\ndisease. \r\n3.  Colonic and rectal wall thickening which may reflect colitis \r\nversus portal colopathy.\r\n4. Heterogeneous appearance of the kidneys with possible \r\nstriated nephrograms. Correlate with urinalysis to exclude \r\npyelonephritis. \r\n\r\n___ TTE:\r\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are \r\nnormal (LVEF = 65%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal \r\nleft ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right \r\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The \r\ndiameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are \r\nnormal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal \r\nwith good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic \r\nregurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. \r\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly myxomatous. Frank mitral \r\nvalve prolapse is not seen but cannot be excluded with \r\ncertainty. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate \r\n(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature \r\nof the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly \r\nunderestimated (Coanda effect). There is borderline pulmonary \r\nartery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.  \r\n\r\n\r\n___ ___\r\nIMPRESSION:   \r\n1. Occlusive thrombus of all right lower extremity deep veins \r\nfrom the common femoral vein down to the calf veins. \r\n2. Patent left lower extremity veins. \r\n\r\n___ ECHO\r\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is \r\nnormal. LV systolic function appears depressed (LVEF = 40%) \r\nsecondary to hypokinesis of the basal two-thirds of the left \r\nventricle. The apical one-third of the left ventricle is \r\nhyperdynamic. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall \r\nmotion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, \r\nascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets \r\n(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No \r\naortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are \r\nmildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic \r\npressure is normal. The pulmonary artery is not well visualized. \r\nThere is no pericardial effusion. \r\n Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \r\nleft ventricular systolic dysfunction is now present. Findings \r\nsuggestive of stress cardiomyopathy with inverse Takotsubo \r\npattern of left ventricular contractile dysfunction.  \r\n\r\n___ CTH:\r\nIMPRESSION: \r\n1. There is mild progression of global cerebral atrophy since \r\nthe prior \r\nexamination of ___, greater than would be expected \r\nfor the \r\npatient's age. \r\n2. No intracranial hemorrhage or territorial infarct. \r\n\r\n___ LIVER US:\r\nIMPRESSION:    \r\n1.  Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of \r\nliver disease including steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, or \r\ncirrhosis cannot be excluded on the basis of this examination. \r\n2.  Trace ascites and small right pleural effusion. \r\n\r\n___ IVC filter placement:\r\nFINDINGS:   \r\n1. Patent normal sized, non-duplicated IVC with  no evidence of \r\na IVC \r\nthrombus. A small circumaortic renal vein originating from the \r\nIVC just above the bifurcation was noted however is very small \r\nin caliber and likely of no clinical significance. \r\n2. Successful deployment of an infra-renal retrievable IVC \r\nfilter. \r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\nSuccessful deployment of an infra-renal removable IVC filter. \r\n\r\n___ ECHO:\r\nConclusions   \r\n The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left \r\nventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular \r\nsystolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). Right ventricular \r\nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve \r\nleaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet \r\nexcursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The \r\nmitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral \r\nregurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary \r\nartery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a \r\ntrivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. \r\n IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved \r\nregional and low normal global biventricular systolic function. \r\nNo valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified. Trivial \r\npericardial effusion. \r\n\r\n___ Unilateral RLE veins \r\nIMPRESSION:    \r\nExtensive deep venous thrombosis involving the wall of the right \r\nlower \r\nextremity veins, overall similar to ___, but now with \r\nperhaps minimal flow in the distal right SFV. \r\n\r\n___ Video oropharyngeal swallow study\r\nAspiration with thin liquid consistency.\r\n\r\n___ Portable abdomen x-ray\r\nPatient is post gastric bypass surgery.  The Dobbhoff tube ends \r\nin the \r\nproximal jejunum. \r\n\r\n___ Renal ultrasound\r\nNo evidence of hydronephrosis.  Increased renal echogenicity \r\nconsistent with diffuse parenchymal renal disease.   \r\nSmall bilateral effusions and small to moderate volume ascites. \r\n\r\n___ - EGD\r\nDuodenum was not examined. Small gastric pouch consistent with \r\nRoux en y anatomy the blind limb and jejunal limb were both \r\nvisualized. No varices. Otherwise normal EGD to the jejunum.\r\n\r\n \r\nBrief Hospital Course:\r\n___ hx gastric bypass surgery, alcohol abuse complicated by \r\nWernicke's encephalopathy, concern for autonomic insufficiency, \r\npresented originally with hypotension, anemia and academia. Her \r\ncourse in the MICU was complicated by severe nutritional \r\ndeficiency, volume overload, renal failure, cardiomyopathy, \r\nhypoxemia and hypoxemic respiratory failure, and deep vein \r\nthrombosis.\r\n\r\n# Hypotension:\r\n# Cardiomyopathy: \r\n# Presumed alcoholic liver disease:\r\nPatient was given 4u PRBCs in the ED prior to FICU admission; \r\nher Hgb was stable for days afterward, and there was low \r\nsuspicion for active GIB initially in her MICU course. She was \r\nempirically antiobiosed for concern of sepsis, but no source was \r\nfound, and these antibiotics were held until a series of \r\npresumed aspiration events that will be discussed below. Morning \r\ncortisol was within normal limits twice; TSH was also within \r\nnormal limits. She underwent several echocardiograms to explain \r\nher persistent hypotension with pressor requirement that showed \r\nin sequence: mitral regurgitation with eccentric jet; inverse \r\nTakutsubo's cardiomyopathy; and then resolution of these issues. \r\nOf note, the resolution occurred after initiation of high-dose \r\nthiamine repletion, which may suggest an element of wet \r\nberiberbi from severe nutritional deficiency in the setting of \r\ngastric bypass and alcoholism. There was also strong suspicion \r\nof cirrhosis given her imaging and alcohol abuse history, for \r\nwhich she was started on midodrine. With these measures, she was \r\nsuccessfully weaned from pressors. Unresolved at the time of her \r\nMICU discharge was a question of autonomic insufficiency raised \r\nin her last Discharge Summary of ___ where it was thought her \r\nalcohol abuse could be contributing to baseline systolic \r\npressures in the ___. This in part resolved on the floor as the \r\npatient was weaned off midodrine and maintained systolic blood \r\npressure in the 100s.\r\n\r\n# Anemia: \r\n-Unexplained, possible GI source with lack of erythropoietin in \r\nthe setting of subacute renal failure . Patient had decreasing \r\npRBC transfusion requirements over the course of her stay, \r\nultimately needing 1U pRBC every 4 days. She was evaluated by \r\nHem/Onc who felt there was no evidence of significant hemolysis \r\nor malignancy and felt that there was an element of anemia of \r\nchronic inflammation, as well as decreased erythropoietin in the \r\nsetting of subacute renal failure. She was evaluated by GI who \r\nfound no source of bleed on sigmoidoscopy early in her course \r\nand no varices or bleeding on EGD. She had an episode of guaiac \r\npositive stool but had no significant bleeding on colonoscopy. \r\nPatient may benefit from outpatient capsule study if bleeding is \r\nongoing.\r\n\r\n# Thrombocytopenia: \r\nThere was no evidence of active bleed on presentation (stool \r\nnormal color, not tachycardic, no clinical or radiographic \r\nevidence of extravasation into a compartment). Surgery and GI \r\nwere consulted early in her MICU course for concern of ischemic \r\ngut in the setting of rising lactate, but flexible sigmoidoscopy \r\nwas negative for this and lactate resolved with fluid \r\nresuscitation. ___ Hematology consulted, and believe her \r\nanemia and thrombocytopenia are likely a combination of \r\nalcoholic bone marrow suppression, malnutrition and critical \r\nillness. She may benefit from a bone marrow biopsy when more \r\nstable; additionally, given her renal failure, she may have a \r\ndeveloping EPO deficiency. She was transfused by ED prior to \r\nMICU admission and did not require further blood products until \r\n___ (gradually dropping Hct attributed to anemia of chronic \r\nillness/inflammation/underproduction; she held her Hct each time \r\nafter transfusion).  \r\n\r\n# Diarrhea:\r\nNegative c. diff, improved over the course of the hospital stay. \r\nPossibly related to tube feeding formulas as this improved with \r\nchanging to a higher fiber formula and with the addition of \r\nbanana flakes. Recommend continued loperamide as needed and \r\noptimization of tube feeds in patient s/p gastric bypass.\r\n\r\n# Renal Failure (Addressed Separately Below):\r\nPresented with serum bicarbonate of 8 of unclear etiology. She \r\nmanifested diarrhea in the early part of her ICU stay (C diff \r\nassay negative, thought related to either alcohol abuse or early \r\ncourse of antibiotics administered empirically for presumed \r\nsepsis, resolved); her renal function markers may also have been \r\nunder-estimates of her true GFR given her nutritionally \r\ndeficient state. Acidemia corrected with bicarbonate drip, but \r\nrecurrence remains in a concern in the setting of her renal \r\nfailure with poor UOP. CRRT was started in the setting of volume \r\noverload in the ICU as described above, though she was noted to \r\nhave ATN by muddy brown casts in her urine as well as \r\npersistently poor UOP. At time of FICU discharge she is being \r\ntrialed off CRRT, though with her poor UOP she may need to be \r\ninitiated on standing dialysis. Upon transfer to the floor, her \r\nrenal function did not improve and she remained oliguric. She \r\nwas evaluated by nephrology who felt that ATN without renal \r\nrecovery was the most likely diagnosis based on her urine \r\nsediment and history. A renal biopsy was considered, but \r\nnephrology felt that the risks of the biopsy on a patient \r\nalready requiring heparin for DVT would outweigh the benefits \r\nwith the suspicion of ATN being high already. Urine output \r\nremained low prior to discharge, and tunneled HD line was placed \r\nfor longer-term access.\r\n\r\n# Respiratory Failure:\r\nPatient developed progressive hypoxemia from volume overload \r\neventually requiring CRRT with resolution of the same. However, \r\non ___ she had an unexplained hypoxemic respiratory episode \r\nwith persistent SpO2 measurements in the ___ despite NRB and NC; \r\nshe was intubated with ___ of continued O2 saturations in \r\nthe ___ before resolution not attributable to any particular \r\nintervention (nebs, suction, etc). This first hypoxemic episode \r\nwas attributed to aspiration though subsequent CXR and \r\nbronchoscopy were not impressive for evidence of the same. She \r\nwas extubated within 24hrs, but then reintubated in the setting \r\nof a break in her CRRT line that caused acute hypotension from \r\nblood loss (trapped in the CRRT circuit) and then hypoxemia. \r\nAfter restoration of hemodynamic stability and passing her RSBI, \r\nshe was again extubated, but re-intubated for nearly the same \r\nexact sequence of events that evening(break in the CRRT circuit \r\ndue to equipment failure; this has been reported and is being \r\ninvestigated). She was finally extubated on ___ and remains \r\noff supplemental O2 at time of MICU discharge. Antibiotics were \r\nempirically started in the setting of possible aspiration with \r\nleukocytosis (that could have been a stress reaction to \r\naspiration pneumonitis or intubations/exbuations); these will \r\nfinish on ___. She completed her course of antibiotics and \r\nremained afebrile and without respiratory distress the rest of \r\nher hospitalization. \r\n\r\n# Alcohol Abuse:\r\nPatient endorses heavy alcohol use. She was seen by social work \r\nwho gave resources, though patient is not interested in \r\ncounseling.\r\n\r\n# Severe Nutritional Deficiency:\r\nNutritional deficiencies including zinc and selenium requiring \r\nsignificant repletion. Repeat testing of zinc showed continued \r\nneed for repletion. Caloric needs and repletion addressed below.\r\n\r\n# Severe malnutrition: likely contributor to pancytopenia \r\nresulting from bone marrow suppression. Required tube feeding \r\ntube feed which was continued at discharge in order to meet her \r\ncaloric needs. She was initially found to aspirate thin liquids \r\nby a speech and swallow evaluation, however on reevaluation \r\nafter receiving tube feeds for some time, she was able to \r\ntolerate a regular diet and thin liquids. Her caloric intake by \r\nmouth was not sufficient to decrease tube feeds.\r\n\r\n# Hx Wernicke's Encephalopathy:\r\nPatient had waxing/waning mental status for much of her early \r\nhospital course which was initially attributed to delirium; \r\nhowever, for history of Wernicke's she was started on high-dose \r\nthiamine that seemed to improve her mental status. Nutrition was \r\nconsulted, and nutrition labs were sent that were all markedly \r\nlow. She was supplemented through her TFs and will need to \r\nremain on standing thiamine.\r\n\r\n# Deep Vein Thrombosis:\r\nPatient arrived to MICU with L femoral CVL; shortly thereafter, \r\nasymmetric R > L lower extremity swelling was noticed for which \r\n___ was obtained - this showed extensive venous clot burden in \r\nthe R lower extremity. IV heparin was started. Because of \r\npersistent thrombocytopenia, an IVC filter was placed, though \r\nbecause of her high clot risk IV heparin was continued. She \r\nshould have interval follow-up of her DVTs after discharge, as \r\nwell as scheduled follow-up with ___ for filter removal. She was \r\nmaintained on a heparin drip and should be bridged to Coumadin \r\nto follow up with hematology/oncology as an outpatient.\r\n \r\n# Concern for Gastrointestinal Bleed:\r\nAs described above, GI and Surgery were consulted early in her \r\nMICU stay for rising lactate and concern of gut ischemia in the \r\nsetting of her hypotension; flexible sigmoidoscopy was \r\nunimpressive and lactate improved with pressors and IVF. Near \r\nthe end of her FICU stay she had fresh blood coating a stool \r\nwhich raised concern for GIB; however, her Hct was stable, she \r\nwas HD stable, and guaiacs of subsequent stools were negative \r\nprior to MICU discharge. She underwent evaluation by Hepatology \r\nand EGD which showed no varices, negative colonoscopy. Capsule \r\nstudy failed, but patient's H/H stabilized and hepatology felt \r\nthe study could be done as an outpatient if necessary.\r\n\r\n**Transitional:**\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n-Patient will need daily assessment for hemodialysis needs, EPO \r\nwith HD given renal failure\r\n-Reassess nutritional status and continued need for tube \r\nfeeding, potential need for G-tube\r\n-Daily electrolytes and every other day CBC to evaluate need for \r\nblood transfusion\r\n-Patient on heparin gtt for DVT. Recommend bridge to coumadin\r\n-Needs appointment with OBGYN for Mirena IUD removal.

The mediastinal and hilar contours are \r\nnormal. The \r\npulmonary vasculature is normal. Lungs are clear.  No pleural \r\neffusion or \r\npneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  \r\nChain sutures are noted in the left upper quadrant of the \r\nabdomen. \r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\nNo acute cardiopulmonary abnormality \r\n\r\n___ CT abd/pelvis:\r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\n1. No active extravasation of contrast to suggest active GI \r\nbleeding at this time. \r\n2. Profound hepatic steatosis.  Enlarged periportal lymph nodes \r\nwith hazy \r\nmesentery and retroperitoneum likely reflect underlying liver \r\ndisease. \r\n3.  Colonic and rectal wall thickening which may reflect colitis \r\nversus portal colopathy.\r\n4. Heterogeneous appearance of the kidneys with possible \r\nstriated nephrograms. Correlate with urinalysis to exclude \r\npyelonephritis. \r\n\r\n___ TTE:\r\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are \r\nnormal (LVEF = 65%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal \r\nleft ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right \r\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The \r\ndiameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are \r\nnormal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal \r\nwith good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic \r\nregurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. \r\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly myxomatous. Frank mitral \r\nvalve prolapse is not seen but cannot be excluded with \r\ncertainty. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate \r\n(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature \r\nof the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly \r\nunderestimated (Coanda effect). There is borderline pulmonary \r\nartery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.  \r\n\r\n\r\n___ ___\r\nIMPRESSION:   \r\n1. Occlusive thrombus of all right lower extremity deep veins \r\nfrom the common femoral vein down to the calf veins. \r\n2. Patent left lower extremity veins. \r\n\r\n___ ECHO\r\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is \r\nnormal. LV systolic function appears depressed (LVEF = 40%) \r\nsecondary to hypokinesis of the basal two-thirds of the left \r\nventricle. The apical one-third of the left ventricle is \r\nhyperdynamic. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall \r\nmotion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, \r\nascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets \r\n(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No \r\naortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are \r\nmildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic \r\npressure is normal. The pulmonary artery is not well visualized. \r\nThere is no pericardial effusion. \r\n Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \r\nleft ventricular systolic dysfunction is now present. Findings \r\nsuggestive of stress cardiomyopathy with inverse Takotsubo \r\npattern of left ventricular contractile dysfunction.  \r\n\r\n___ CTH:\r\nIMPRESSION: \r\n1. There is mild progression of global cerebral atrophy since \r\nthe prior \r\nexamination of ___, greater than would be expected \r\nfor the \r\npatient's age. \r\n2. No intracranial hemorrhage or territorial infarct. \r\n\r\n___ LIVER US:\r\nIMPRESSION:    \r\n1.  Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of \r\nliver disease including steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, or \r\ncirrhosis cannot be excluded on the basis of this examination. \r\n2.  Trace ascites and small right pleural effusion. \r\n\r\n___ IVC filter placement:\r\nFINDINGS:   \r\n1. Patent normal sized, non-duplicated IVC with  no evidence of \r\na IVC \r\nthrombus. A small circumaortic renal vein originating from the \r\nIVC just above the bifurcation was noted however is very small \r\nin caliber and likely of no clinical significance. \r\n2. Successful deployment of an infra-renal retrievable IVC \r\nfilter. \r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\nSuccessful deployment of an infra-renal removable IVC filter. \r\n\r\n___ ECHO:\r\nConclusions   \r\n The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left \r\nventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular \r\nsystolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). Right ventricular \r\nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve \r\nleaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet \r\nexcursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The \r\nmitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral \r\nregurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary \r\nartery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a \r\ntrivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. \r\n IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved \r\nregional and low normal global biventricular systolic function. \r\nNo valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified. Trivial \r\npericardial effusion. \r\n\r\n___ Unilateral RLE veins \r\nIMPRESSION:    \r\nExtensive deep venous thrombosis involving the wall of the right \r\nlower \r\nextremity veins, overall similar to ___, but now with \r\nperhaps minimal flow in the distal right SFV. \r\n\r\n___ Video oropharyngeal swallow study\r\nAspiration with thin liquid consistency.\r\n\r\n___ Portable abdomen x-ray\r\nPatient is post gastric bypass surgery.  The Dobbhoff tube ends \r\nin the \r\nproximal jejunum. \r\n\r\n___ Renal ultrasound\r\nNo evidence of hydronephrosis.  Increased renal echogenicity \r\nconsistent with diffuse parenchymal renal disease.   \r\nSmall bilateral effusions and small to moderate volume ascites. \r\n\r\n___ - EGD\r\nDuodenum was not examined. Small gastric pouch consistent with \r\nRoux en y anatomy the blind limb and jejunal limb were both \r\nvisualized. No varices. Otherwise normal EGD to the jejunum.\r\n\r\n \r\nBrief Hospital Course:\r\n___ hx gastric bypass surgery, alcohol abuse complicated by \r\nWernicke's encephalopathy, concern for autonomic insufficiency, \r\npresented originally with hypotension, anemia and academia. Her \r\ncourse in the MICU was complicated by severe nutritional \r\ndeficiency, volume overload, renal failure, cardiomyopathy, \r\nhypoxemia and hypoxemic respiratory failure, and deep vein \r\nthrombosis.\r\n\r\n# Hypotension:\r\n# Cardiomyopathy: \r\n# Presumed alcoholic liver disease:\r\nPatient was given 4u PRBCs in the ED prior to FICU admission; \r\nher Hgb was stable for days afterward, and there was low \r\nsuspicion for active GIB initially in her MICU course. She was \r\nempirically antiobiosed for concern of sepsis, but no source was \r\nfound, and these antibiotics were held until a series of \r\npresumed aspiration events that will be discussed below. Morning \r\ncortisol was within normal limits twice; TSH was also within \r\nnormal limits. She underwent several echocardiograms to explain \r\nher persistent hypotension with pressor requirement that showed \r\nin sequence: mitral regurgitation with eccentric jet; inverse \r\nTakutsubo's cardiomyopathy; and then resolution of these issues. \r\nOf note, the resolution occurred after initiation of high-dose \r\nthiamine repletion, which may suggest an element of wet \r\nberiberbi from severe nutritional deficiency in the setting of \r\ngastric bypass and alcoholism. There was also strong suspicion \r\nof cirrhosis given her imaging and alcohol abuse history, for \r\nwhich she was started on midodrine. With these measures, she was \r\nsuccessfully weaned from pressors. Unresolved at the time of her \r\nMICU discharge was a question of autonomic insufficiency raised \r\nin her last Discharge Summary of ___ where it was thought her \r\nalcohol abuse could be contributing to baseline systolic \r\npressures in the ___. This in part resolved on the floor as the \r\npatient was weaned off midodrine and maintained systolic blood \r\npressure in the 100s.\r\n\r\n# Anemia: \r\n-Unexplained, possible GI source with lack of erythropoietin in \r\nthe setting of subacute renal failure . Patient had decreasing \r\npRBC transfusion requirements over the course of her stay, \r\nultimately needing 1U pRBC every 4 days. She was evaluated by \r\nHem/Onc who felt there was no evidence of significant hemolysis \r\nor malignancy and felt that there was an element of anemia of \r\nchronic inflammation, as well as decreased erythropoietin in the \r\nsetting of subacute renal failure. She was evaluated by GI who \r\nfound no source of bleed on sigmoidoscopy early in her course \r\nand no varices or bleeding on EGD. She had an episode of guaiac \r\npositive stool but had no significant bleeding on colonoscopy. \r\nPatient may benefit from outpatient capsule study if bleeding is \r\nongoing.\r\n\r\n# Thrombocytopenia: \r\nThere was no evidence of active bleed on presentation (stool \r\nnormal color, not tachycardic, no clinical or radiographic \r\nevidence of extravasation into a compartment). Surgery and GI \r\nwere consulted early in her MICU course for concern of ischemic \r\ngut in the setting of rising lactate, but flexible sigmoidoscopy \r\nwas negative for this and lactate resolved with fluid \r\nresuscitation. ___ Hematology consulted, and believe her \r\nanemia and thrombocytopenia are likely a combination of \r\nalcoholic bone marrow suppression, malnutrition and critical \r\nillness. She may benefit from a bone marrow biopsy when more \r\nstable; additionally, given her renal failure, she may have a \r\ndeveloping EPO deficiency. She was transfused by ED prior to \r\nMICU admission and did not require further blood products until \r\n___ (gradually dropping Hct attributed to anemia of chronic \r\nillness/inflammation/underproduction; she held her Hct each time \r\nafter transfusion).  \r\n\r\n# Diarrhea:\r\nNegative c. diff, improved over the course of the hospital stay. \r\nPossibly related to tube feeding formulas as this improved with \r\nchanging to a higher fiber formula and with the addition of \r\nbanana flakes. Recommend continued loperamide as needed and \r\noptimization of tube feeds in patient s/p gastric bypass.\r\n\r\n# Renal Failure (Addressed Separately Below):\r\nPresented with serum bicarbonate of 8 of unclear etiology. She \r\nmanifested diarrhea in the early part of her ICU stay (C diff \r\nassay negative, thought related to either alcohol abuse or early \r\ncourse of antibiotics administered empirically for presumed \r\nsepsis, resolved); her renal function markers may also have been \r\nunder-estimates of her true GFR given her nutritionally \r\ndeficient state. Acidemia corrected with bicarbonate drip, but \r\nrecurrence remains in a concern in the setting of her renal \r\nfailure with poor UOP. CRRT was started in the setting of volume \r\noverload in the ICU as described above, though she was noted to \r\nhave ATN by muddy brown casts in her urine as well as \r\npersistently poor UOP. At time of FICU discharge she is being \r\ntrialed off CRRT, though with her poor UOP she may need to be \r\ninitiated on standing dialysis. Upon transfer to the floor, her \r\nrenal function did not improve and she remained oliguric. She \r\nwas evaluated by nephrology who felt that ATN without renal \r\nrecovery was the most likely diagnosis based on her urine \r\nsediment and history. A renal biopsy was considered, but \r\nnephrology felt that the risks of the biopsy on a patient \r\nalready requiring heparin for DVT would outweigh the benefits \r\nwith the suspicion of ATN being high already. Urine output \r\nremained low prior to discharge, and tunneled HD line was placed \r\nfor longer-term access.\r\n\r\n# Respiratory Failure:\r\nPatient developed progressive hypoxemia from volume overload \r\neventually requiring CRRT with resolution of the same. However, \r\non ___ she had an unexplained hypoxemic respiratory episode \r\nwith persistent SpO2 measurements in the ___ despite NRB and NC; \r\nshe was intubated with ___ of continued O2 saturations in \r\nthe ___ before resolution not attributable to any particular \r\nintervention (nebs, suction, etc). This first hypoxemic episode \r\nwas attributed to aspiration though subsequent CXR and \r\nbronchoscopy were not impressive for evidence of the same. She \r\nwas extubated within 24hrs, but then reintubated in the setting \r\nof a break in her CRRT line that caused acute hypotension from \r\nblood loss (trapped in the CRRT circuit) and then hypoxemia. \r\nAfter restoration of hemodynamic stability and passing her RSBI, \r\nshe was again extubated, but re-intubated for nearly the same \r\nexact sequence of events that evening(break in the CRRT circuit \r\ndue to equipment failure; this has been reported and is being \r\ninvestigated). She was finally extubated on ___ and remains \r\noff supplemental O2 at time of MICU discharge. Antibiotics were \r\nempirically started in the setting of possible aspiration with \r\nleukocytosis (that could have been a stress reaction to \r\naspiration pneumonitis or intubations/exbuations); these will \r\nfinish on ___. She completed her course of antibiotics and \r\nremained afebrile and without respiratory distress the rest of \r\nher hospitalization. \r\n\r\n# Alcohol Abuse:\r\nPatient endorses heavy alcohol use. She was seen by social work \r\nwho gave resources, though patient is not interested in \r\ncounseling.\r\n\r\n# Severe Nutritional Deficiency:\r\nNutritional deficiencies including zinc and selenium requiring \r\nsignificant repletion. Repeat testing of zinc showed continued \r\nneed for repletion. Caloric needs and repletion addressed below.\r\n\r\n# Severe malnutrition: likely contributor to pancytopenia \r\nresulting from bone marrow suppression. Required tube feeding \r\ntube feed which was continued at discharge in order to meet her \r\ncaloric needs. She was initially found to aspirate thin liquids \r\nby a speech and swallow evaluation, however on reevaluation \r\nafter receiving tube feeds for some time, she was able to \r\ntolerate a regular diet and thin liquids. Her caloric intake by \r\nmouth was not sufficient to decrease tube feeds.\r\n\r\n# Hx Wernicke's Encephalopathy:\r\nPatient had waxing/waning mental status for much of her early \r\nhospital course which was initially attributed to delirium; \r\nhowever, for history of Wernicke's she was started on high-dose \r\nthiamine that seemed to improve her mental status. Nutrition was \r\nconsulted, and nutrition labs were sent that were all markedly \r\nlow. She was supplemented through her TFs and will need to \r\nremain on standing thiamine.\r\n\r\n# Deep Vein Thrombosis:\r\nPatient arrived to MICU with L femoral CVL; shortly thereafter, \r\nasymmetric R > L lower extremity swelling was noticed for which \r\n___ was obtained - this showed extensive venous clot burden in \r\nthe R lower extremity. IV heparin was started. Because of \r\npersistent thrombocytopenia, an IVC filter was placed, though \r\nbecause of her high clot risk IV heparin was continued. She \r\nshould have interval follow-up of her DVTs after discharge, as \r\nwell as scheduled follow-up with ___ for filter removal. She was \r\nmaintained on a heparin drip and should be bridged to Coumadin \r\nto follow up with hematology/oncology as an outpatient.\r\n \r\n# Concern for Gastrointestinal Bleed:\r\nAs described above, GI and Surgery were consulted early in her \r\nMICU stay for rising lactate and concern of gut ischemia in the \r\nsetting of her hypotension; flexible sigmoidoscopy was \r\nunimpressive and lactate improved with pressors and IVF. Near \r\nthe end of her FICU stay she had fresh blood coating a stool \r\nwhich raised concern for GIB; however, her Hct was stable, she \r\nwas HD stable, and guaiacs of subsequent stools were negative \r\nprior to MICU discharge. She underwent evaluation by Hepatology \r\nand EGD which showed no varices, negative colonoscopy. Capsule \r\nstudy failed, but patient's H/H stabilized and hepatology felt \r\nthe study could be done as an outpatient if necessary.\r\n\r\n**Transitional:**\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n-Patient will need daily assessment for hemodialysis needs, EPO \r\nwith HD given renal failure\r\n-Reassess nutritional status and continued need for tube \r\nfeeding, potential need for G-tube\r\n-Daily electrolytes and every other day CBC to evaluate need for \r\nblood transfusion\r\n-Patient on heparin gtt for DVT.

The mediastinal and hilar contours are \r\nnormal. The \r\npulmonary vasculature is normal. Lungs are clear.  No pleural \r\neffusion or \r\npneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  \r\nChain sutures are noted in the left upper quadrant of the \r\nabdomen. \r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\nNo acute cardiopulmonary abnormality \r\n\r\n___ CT abd/pelvis:\r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\n1. No active extravasation of contrast to suggest active GI \r\nbleeding at this time. \r\n2. Profound hepatic steatosis.  Enlarged periportal lymph nodes \r\nwith hazy \r\nmesentery and retroperitoneum likely reflect underlying liver \r\ndisease. \r\n3.  Colonic and rectal wall thickening which may reflect colitis \r\nversus portal colopathy.\r\n4. Heterogeneous appearance of the kidneys with possible \r\nstriated nephrograms. Correlate with urinalysis to exclude \r\npyelonephritis. \r\n\r\n___ TTE:\r\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are \r\nnormal (LVEF = 65%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal \r\nleft ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right \r\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The \r\ndiameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are \r\nnormal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal \r\nwith good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic \r\nregurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. \r\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly myxomatous. Frank mitral \r\nvalve prolapse is not seen but cannot be excluded with \r\ncertainty. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate \r\n(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature \r\nof the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly \r\nunderestimated (Coanda effect). There is borderline pulmonary \r\nartery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.  \r\n\r\n\r\n___ ___\r\nIMPRESSION:   \r\n1. Occlusive thrombus of all right lower extremity deep veins \r\nfrom the common femoral vein down to the calf veins. \r\n2. Patent left lower extremity veins. \r\n\r\n___ ECHO\r\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is \r\nnormal. LV systolic function appears depressed (LVEF = 40%) \r\nsecondary to hypokinesis of the basal two-thirds of the left \r\nventricle. The apical one-third of the left ventricle is \r\nhyperdynamic. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall \r\nmotion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, \r\nascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets \r\n(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No \r\naortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are \r\nmildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic \r\npressure is normal. The pulmonary artery is not well visualized. \r\nThere is no pericardial effusion. \r\n Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \r\nleft ventricular systolic dysfunction is now present. Findings \r\nsuggestive of stress cardiomyopathy with inverse Takotsubo \r\npattern of left ventricular contractile dysfunction.  \r\n\r\n___ CTH:\r\nIMPRESSION: \r\n1. There is mild progression of global cerebral atrophy since \r\nthe prior \r\nexamination of ___, greater than would be expected \r\nfor the \r\npatient's age. \r\n2. No intracranial hemorrhage or territorial infarct. \r\n\r\n___ LIVER US:\r\nIMPRESSION:    \r\n1.  Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of \r\nliver disease including steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, or \r\ncirrhosis cannot be excluded on the basis of this examination. \r\n2.  Trace ascites and small right pleural effusion. \r\n\r\n___ IVC filter placement:\r\nFINDINGS:   \r\n1. Patent normal sized, non-duplicated IVC with  no evidence of \r\na IVC \r\nthrombus. A small circumaortic renal vein originating from the \r\nIVC just above the bifurcation was noted however is very small \r\nin caliber and likely of no clinical significance. \r\n2. Successful deployment of an infra-renal retrievable IVC \r\nfilter. \r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\nSuccessful deployment of an infra-renal removable IVC filter. \r\n\r\n___ ECHO:\r\nConclusions   \r\n The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left \r\nventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular \r\nsystolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). Right ventricular \r\nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve \r\nleaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet \r\nexcursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The \r\nmitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral \r\nregurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary \r\nartery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a \r\ntrivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. \r\n IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved \r\nregional and low normal global biventricular systolic function. \r\nNo valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified. Trivial \r\npericardial effusion. \r\n\r\n___ Unilateral RLE veins \r\nIMPRESSION:    \r\nExtensive deep venous thrombosis involving the wall of the right \r\nlower \r\nextremity veins, overall similar to ___, but now with \r\nperhaps minimal flow in the distal right SFV. \r\n\r\n___ Video oropharyngeal swallow study\r\nAspiration with thin liquid consistency.\r\n\r\n___ Portable abdomen x-ray\r\nPatient is post gastric bypass surgery.  The Dobbhoff tube ends \r\nin the \r\nproximal jejunum. \r\n\r\n___ Renal ultrasound\r\nNo evidence of hydronephrosis.  Increased renal echogenicity \r\nconsistent with diffuse parenchymal renal disease.   \r\nSmall bilateral effusions and small to moderate volume ascites. \r\n\r\n___ - EGD\r\nDuodenum was not examined. Small gastric pouch consistent with \r\nRoux en y anatomy the blind limb and jejunal limb were both \r\nvisualized. No varices. Otherwise normal EGD to the jejunum.\r\n\r\n \r\nBrief Hospital Course:\r\n___ hx gastric bypass surgery, alcohol abuse complicated by \r\nWernicke's encephalopathy, concern for autonomic insufficiency, \r\npresented originally with hypotension, anemia and academia. Her \r\ncourse in the MICU was complicated by severe nutritional \r\ndeficiency, volume overload, renal failure, cardiomyopathy, \r\nhypoxemia and hypoxemic respiratory failure, and deep vein \r\nthrombosis.\r\n\r\n# Hypotension:\r\n# Cardiomyopathy: \r\n# Presumed alcoholic liver disease:\r\nPatient was given 4u PRBCs in the ED prior to FICU admission; \r\nher Hgb was stable for days afterward, and there was low \r\nsuspicion for active GIB initially in her MICU course. She was \r\nempirically antiobiosed for concern of sepsis, but no source was \r\nfound, and these antibiotics were held until a series of \r\npresumed aspiration events that will be discussed below. Morning \r\ncortisol was within normal limits twice; TSH was also within \r\nnormal limits. She underwent several echocardiograms to explain \r\nher persistent hypotension with pressor requirement that showed \r\nin sequence: mitral regurgitation with eccentric jet; inverse \r\nTakutsubo's cardiomyopathy; and then resolution of these issues. \r\nOf note, the resolution occurred after initiation of high-dose \r\nthiamine repletion, which may suggest an element of wet \r\nberiberbi from severe nutritional deficiency in the setting of \r\ngastric bypass and alcoholism. There was also strong suspicion \r\nof cirrhosis given her imaging and alcohol abuse history, for \r\nwhich she was started on midodrine. With these measures, she was \r\nsuccessfully weaned from pressors. Unresolved at the time of her \r\nMICU discharge was a question of autonomic insufficiency raised \r\nin her last Discharge Summary of ___ where it was thought her \r\nalcohol abuse could be contributing to baseline systolic \r\npressures in the ___. This in part resolved on the floor as the \r\npatient was weaned off midodrine and maintained systolic blood \r\npressure in the 100s.\r\n\r\n# Anemia: \r\n-Unexplained, possible GI source with lack of erythropoietin in \r\nthe setting of subacute renal failure . Patient had decreasing \r\npRBC transfusion requirements over the course of her stay, \r\nultimately needing 1U pRBC every 4 days. She was evaluated by \r\nHem/Onc who felt there was no evidence of significant hemolysis \r\nor malignancy and felt that there was an element of anemia of \r\nchronic inflammation, as well as decreased erythropoietin in the \r\nsetting of subacute renal failure. She was evaluated by GI who \r\nfound no source of bleed on sigmoidoscopy early in her course \r\nand no varices or bleeding on EGD. She had an episode of guaiac \r\npositive stool but had no significant bleeding on colonoscopy. \r\nPatient may benefit from outpatient capsule study if bleeding is \r\nongoing.\r\n\r\n# Thrombocytopenia: \r\nThere was no evidence of active bleed on presentation (stool \r\nnormal color, not tachycardic, no clinical or radiographic \r\nevidence of extravasation into a compartment). Surgery and GI \r\nwere consulted early in her MICU course for concern of ischemic \r\ngut in the setting of rising lactate, but flexible sigmoidoscopy \r\nwas negative for this and lactate resolved with fluid \r\nresuscitation. ___ Hematology consulted, and believe her \r\nanemia and thrombocytopenia are likely a combination of \r\nalcoholic bone marrow suppression, malnutrition and critical \r\nillness. She may benefit from a bone marrow biopsy when more \r\nstable; additionally, given her renal failure, she may have a \r\ndeveloping EPO deficiency. She was transfused by ED prior to \r\nMICU admission and did not require further blood products until \r\n___ (gradually dropping Hct attributed to anemia of chronic \r\nillness/inflammation/underproduction; she held her Hct each time \r\nafter transfusion).  \r\n\r\n# Diarrhea:\r\nNegative c. diff, improved over the course of the hospital stay. \r\nPossibly related to tube feeding formulas as this improved with \r\nchanging to a higher fiber formula and with the addition of \r\nbanana flakes. Recommend continued loperamide as needed and \r\noptimization of tube feeds in patient s/p gastric bypass.\r\n\r\n# Renal Failure (Addressed Separately Below):\r\nPresented with serum bicarbonate of 8 of unclear etiology. She \r\nmanifested diarrhea in the early part of her ICU stay (C diff \r\nassay negative, thought related to either alcohol abuse or early \r\ncourse of antibiotics administered empirically for presumed \r\nsepsis, resolved); her renal function markers may also have been \r\nunder-estimates of her true GFR given her nutritionally \r\ndeficient state. Acidemia corrected with bicarbonate drip, but \r\nrecurrence remains in a concern in the setting of her renal \r\nfailure with poor UOP. CRRT was started in the setting of volume \r\noverload in the ICU as described above, though she was noted to \r\nhave ATN by muddy brown casts in her urine as well as \r\npersistently poor UOP. At time of FICU discharge she is being \r\ntrialed off CRRT, though with her poor UOP she may need to be \r\ninitiated on standing dialysis. Upon transfer to the floor, her \r\nrenal function did not improve and she remained oliguric. She \r\nwas evaluated by nephrology who felt that ATN without renal \r\nrecovery was the most likely diagnosis based on her urine \r\nsediment and history. A renal biopsy was considered, but \r\nnephrology felt that the risks of the biopsy on a patient \r\nalready requiring heparin for DVT would outweigh the benefits \r\nwith the suspicion of ATN being high already. Urine output \r\nremained low prior to discharge, and tunneled HD line was placed \r\nfor longer-term access.\r\n\r\n# Respiratory Failure:\r\nPatient developed progressive hypoxemia from volume overload \r\neventually requiring CRRT with resolution of the same. However, \r\non ___ she had an unexplained hypoxemic respiratory episode \r\nwith persistent SpO2 measurements in the ___ despite NRB and NC; \r\nshe was intubated with ___ of continued O2 saturations in \r\nthe ___ before resolution not attributable to any particular \r\nintervention (nebs, suction, etc). This first hypoxemic episode \r\nwas attributed to aspiration though subsequent CXR and \r\nbronchoscopy were not impressive for evidence of the same. She \r\nwas extubated within 24hrs, but then reintubated in the setting \r\nof a break in her CRRT line that caused acute hypotension from \r\nblood loss (trapped in the CRRT circuit) and then hypoxemia. \r\nAfter restoration of hemodynamic stability and passing her RSBI, \r\nshe was again extubated, but re-intubated for nearly the same \r\nexact sequence of events that evening(break in the CRRT circuit \r\ndue to equipment failure; this has been reported and is being \r\ninvestigated). She was finally extubated on ___ and remains \r\noff supplemental O2 at time of MICU discharge. Antibiotics were \r\nempirically started in the setting of possible aspiration with \r\nleukocytosis (that could have been a stress reaction to \r\naspiration pneumonitis or intubations/exbuations); these will \r\nfinish on ___. She completed her course of antibiotics and \r\nremained afebrile and without respiratory distress the rest of \r\nher hospitalization. \r\n\r\n# Alcohol Abuse:\r\nPatient endorses heavy alcohol use. She was seen by social work \r\nwho gave resources, though patient is not interested in \r\ncounseling.\r\n\r\n# Severe Nutritional Deficiency:\r\nNutritional deficiencies including zinc and selenium requiring \r\nsignificant repletion. Repeat testing of zinc showed continued \r\nneed for repletion. Caloric needs and repletion addressed below.\r\n\r\n# Severe malnutrition: likely contributor to pancytopenia \r\nresulting from bone marrow suppression. Required tube feeding \r\ntube feed which was continued at discharge in order to meet her \r\ncaloric needs. She was initially found to aspirate thin liquids \r\nby a speech and swallow evaluation, however on reevaluation \r\nafter receiving tube feeds for some time, she was able to \r\ntolerate a regular diet and thin liquids. Her caloric intake by \r\nmouth was not sufficient to decrease tube feeds.\r\n\r\n# Hx Wernicke's Encephalopathy:\r\nPatient had waxing/waning mental status for much of her early \r\nhospital course which was initially attributed to delirium; \r\nhowever, for history of Wernicke's she was started on high-dose \r\nthiamine that seemed to improve her mental status. Nutrition was \r\nconsulted, and nutrition labs were sent that were all markedly \r\nlow. She was supplemented through her TFs and will need to \r\nremain on standing thiamine.\r\n\r\n# Deep Vein Thrombosis:\r\nPatient arrived to MICU with L femoral CVL; shortly thereafter, \r\nasymmetric R > L lower extremity swelling was noticed for which \r\n___ was obtained - this showed extensive venous clot burden in \r\nthe R lower extremity. IV heparin was started. Because of \r\npersistent thrombocytopenia, an IVC filter was placed, though \r\nbecause of her high clot risk IV heparin was continued. She \r\nshould have interval follow-up of her DVTs after discharge, as \r\nwell as scheduled follow-up with ___ for filter removal. She was \r\nmaintained on a heparin drip and should be bridged to Coumadin \r\nto follow up with hematology/oncology as an outpatient.\r\n \r\n# Concern for Gastrointestinal Bleed:\r\nAs described above, GI and Surgery were consulted early in her \r\nMICU stay for rising lactate and concern of gut ischemia in the \r\nsetting of her hypotension; flexible sigmoidoscopy was \r\nunimpressive and lactate improved with pressors and IVF. Near \r\nthe end of her FICU stay she had fresh blood coating a stool \r\nwhich raised concern for GIB; however, her Hct was stable, she \r\nwas HD stable, and guaiacs of subsequent stools were negative \r\nprior to MICU discharge. She underwent evaluation by Hepatology \r\nand EGD which showed no varices, negative colonoscopy. Capsule \r\nstudy failed, but patient's H/H stabilized and hepatology felt \r\nthe study could be done as an outpatient if necessary.\r\n\r\n**Transitional:**\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n-Patient will need daily assessment for hemodialysis needs, EPO \r\nwith HD given renal failure\r\n-Reassess nutritional status and continued need for tube \r\nfeeding, potential need for G-tube\r\n-Daily electrolytes and every other day CBC to evaluate need for \r\nblood transfusion\r\n-Patient on heparin gtt for DVT.

The mediastinal and hilar contours are \r\nnormal. The \r\npulmonary vasculature is normal. Lungs are clear.  No pleural \r\neffusion or \r\npneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  \r\nChain sutures are noted in the left upper quadrant of the \r\nabdomen. \r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\nNo acute cardiopulmonary abnormality \r\n\r\n___ CT abd/pelvis:\r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\n1. No active extravasation of contrast to suggest active GI \r\nbleeding at this time. \r\n2. Profound hepatic steatosis.  Enlarged periportal lymph nodes \r\nwith hazy \r\nmesentery and retroperitoneum likely reflect underlying liver \r\ndisease. \r\n3.  Colonic and rectal wall thickening which may reflect colitis \r\nversus portal colopathy.\r\n4. Heterogeneous appearance of the kidneys with possible \r\nstriated nephrograms. Correlate with urinalysis to exclude \r\npyelonephritis. \r\n\r\n___ TTE:\r\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are \r\nnormal (LVEF = 65%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal \r\nleft ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right \r\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The \r\ndiameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are \r\nnormal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal \r\nwith good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic \r\nregurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. \r\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly myxomatous. Frank mitral \r\nvalve prolapse is not seen but cannot be excluded with \r\ncertainty. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate \r\n(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature \r\nof the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly \r\nunderestimated (Coanda effect). There is borderline pulmonary \r\nartery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.  \r\n\r\n\r\n___ ___\r\nIMPRESSION:   \r\n1. Occlusive thrombus of all right lower extremity deep veins \r\nfrom the common femoral vein down to the calf veins. \r\n2. Patent left lower extremity veins. \r\n\r\n___ ECHO\r\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is \r\nnormal. LV systolic function appears depressed (LVEF = 40%) \r\nsecondary to hypokinesis of the basal two-thirds of the left \r\nventricle. The apical one-third of the left ventricle is \r\nhyperdynamic. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall \r\nmotion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, \r\nascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets \r\n(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No \r\naortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are \r\nmildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic \r\npressure is normal. The pulmonary artery is not well visualized. \r\nThere is no pericardial effusion. \r\n Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \r\nleft ventricular systolic dysfunction is now present. Findings \r\nsuggestive of stress cardiomyopathy with inverse Takotsubo \r\npattern of left ventricular contractile dysfunction.  \r\n\r\n___ CTH:\r\nIMPRESSION: \r\n1. There is mild progression of global cerebral atrophy since \r\nthe prior \r\nexamination of ___, greater than would be expected \r\nfor the \r\npatient's age. \r\n2. No intracranial hemorrhage or territorial infarct. \r\n\r\n___ LIVER US:\r\nIMPRESSION:    \r\n1.  Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of \r\nliver disease including steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, or \r\ncirrhosis cannot be excluded on the basis of this examination. \r\n2.  Trace ascites and small right pleural effusion. \r\n\r\n___ IVC filter placement:\r\nFINDINGS:   \r\n1. Patent normal sized, non-duplicated IVC with  no evidence of \r\na IVC \r\nthrombus. A small circumaortic renal vein originating from the \r\nIVC just above the bifurcation was noted however is very small \r\nin caliber and likely of no clinical significance. \r\n2. Successful deployment of an infra-renal retrievable IVC \r\nfilter. \r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\nSuccessful deployment of an infra-renal removable IVC filter. \r\n\r\n___ ECHO:\r\nConclusions   \r\n The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left \r\nventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular \r\nsystolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). Right ventricular \r\nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve \r\nleaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet \r\nexcursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The \r\nmitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral \r\nregurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary \r\nartery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a \r\ntrivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. \r\n IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved \r\nregional and low normal global biventricular systolic function. \r\nNo valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified. Trivial \r\npericardial effusion. \r\n\r\n___ Unilateral RLE veins \r\nIMPRESSION:    \r\nExtensive deep venous thrombosis involving the wall of the right \r\nlower \r\nextremity veins, overall similar to ___, but now with \r\nperhaps minimal flow in the distal right SFV. \r\n\r\n___ Video oropharyngeal swallow study\r\nAspiration with thin liquid consistency.\r\n\r\n___ Portable abdomen x-ray\r\nPatient is post gastric bypass surgery.  The Dobbhoff tube ends \r\nin the \r\nproximal jejunum. \r\n\r\n___ Renal ultrasound\r\nNo evidence of hydronephrosis.  Increased renal echogenicity \r\nconsistent with diffuse parenchymal renal disease.   \r\nSmall bilateral effusions and small to moderate volume ascites. \r\n\r\n___ - EGD\r\nDuodenum was not examined. Small gastric pouch consistent with \r\nRoux en y anatomy the blind limb and jejunal limb were both \r\nvisualized. No varices. Otherwise normal EGD to the jejunum.\r\n\r\n \r\nBrief Hospital Course:\r\n___ hx gastric bypass surgery, alcohol abuse complicated by \r\nWernicke's encephalopathy, concern for autonomic insufficiency, \r\npresented originally with hypotension, anemia and academia. Her \r\ncourse in the MICU was complicated by severe nutritional \r\ndeficiency, volume overload, renal failure, cardiomyopathy, \r\nhypoxemia and hypoxemic respiratory failure, and deep vein \r\nthrombosis.\r\n\r\n# Hypotension:\r\n# Cardiomyopathy: \r\n# Presumed alcoholic liver disease:\r\nPatient was given 4u PRBCs in the ED prior to FICU admission; \r\nher Hgb was stable for days afterward, and there was low \r\nsuspicion for active GIB initially in her MICU course. She was \r\nempirically antiobiosed for concern of sepsis, but no source was \r\nfound, and these antibiotics were held until a series of \r\npresumed aspiration events that will be discussed below. Morning \r\ncortisol was within normal limits twice; TSH was also within \r\nnormal limits. She underwent several echocardiograms to explain \r\nher persistent hypotension with pressor requirement that showed \r\nin sequence: mitral regurgitation with eccentric jet; inverse \r\nTakutsubo's cardiomyopathy; and then resolution of these issues. \r\nOf note, the resolution occurred after initiation of high-dose \r\nthiamine repletion, which may suggest an element of wet \r\nberiberbi from severe nutritional deficiency in the setting of \r\ngastric bypass and alcoholism. There was also strong suspicion \r\nof cirrhosis given her imaging and alcohol abuse history, for \r\nwhich she was started on midodrine. With these measures, she was \r\nsuccessfully weaned from pressors. Unresolved at the time of her \r\nMICU discharge was a question of autonomic insufficiency raised \r\nin her last Discharge Summary of ___ where it was thought her \r\nalcohol abuse could be contributing to baseline systolic \r\npressures in the ___. This in part resolved on the floor as the \r\npatient was weaned off midodrine and maintained systolic blood \r\npressure in the 100s.\r\n\r\n# Anemia: \r\n-Unexplained, possible GI source with lack of erythropoietin in \r\nthe setting of subacute renal failure . Patient had decreasing \r\npRBC transfusion requirements over the course of her stay, \r\nultimately needing 1U pRBC every 4 days. She was evaluated by \r\nHem/Onc who felt there was no evidence of significant hemolysis \r\nor malignancy and felt that there was an element of anemia of \r\nchronic inflammation, as well as decreased erythropoietin in the \r\nsetting of subacute renal failure. She was evaluated by GI who \r\nfound no source of bleed on sigmoidoscopy early in her course \r\nand no varices or bleeding on EGD. She had an episode of guaiac \r\npositive stool but had no significant bleeding on colonoscopy. \r\nPatient may benefit from outpatient capsule study if bleeding is \r\nongoing.\r\n\r\n# Thrombocytopenia: \r\nThere was no evidence of active bleed on presentation (stool \r\nnormal color, not tachycardic, no clinical or radiographic \r\nevidence of extravasation into a compartment). Surgery and GI \r\nwere consulted early in her MICU course for concern of ischemic \r\ngut in the setting of rising lactate, but flexible sigmoidoscopy \r\nwas negative for this and lactate resolved with fluid \r\nresuscitation. ___ Hematology consulted, and believe her \r\nanemia and thrombocytopenia are likely a combination of \r\nalcoholic bone marrow suppression, malnutrition and critical \r\nillness. She may benefit from a bone marrow biopsy when more \r\nstable; additionally, given her renal failure, she may have a \r\ndeveloping EPO deficiency. She was transfused by ED prior to \r\nMICU admission and did not require further blood products until \r\n___ (gradually dropping Hct attributed to anemia of chronic \r\nillness/inflammation/underproduction; she held her Hct each time \r\nafter transfusion).  \r\n\r\n# Diarrhea:\r\nNegative c. diff, improved over the course of the hospital stay. \r\nPossibly related to tube feeding formulas as this improved with \r\nchanging to a higher fiber formula and with the addition of \r\nbanana flakes. Recommend continued loperamide as needed and \r\noptimization of tube feeds in patient s/p gastric bypass.\r\n\r\n# Renal Failure (Addressed Separately Below):\r\nPresented with serum bicarbonate of 8 of unclear etiology. She \r\nmanifested diarrhea in the early part of her ICU stay (C diff \r\nassay negative, thought related to either alcohol abuse or early \r\ncourse of antibiotics administered empirically for presumed \r\nsepsis, resolved); her renal function markers may also have been \r\nunder-estimates of her true GFR given her nutritionally \r\ndeficient state. Acidemia corrected with bicarbonate drip, but \r\nrecurrence remains in a concern in the setting of her renal \r\nfailure with poor UOP. CRRT was started in the setting of volume \r\noverload in the ICU as described above, though she was noted to \r\nhave ATN by muddy brown casts in her urine as well as \r\npersistently poor UOP. At time of FICU discharge she is being \r\ntrialed off CRRT, though with her poor UOP she may need to be \r\ninitiated on standing dialysis. Upon transfer to the floor, her \r\nrenal function did not improve and she remained oliguric. She \r\nwas evaluated by nephrology who felt that ATN without renal \r\nrecovery was the most likely diagnosis based on her urine \r\nsediment and history. A renal biopsy was considered, but \r\nnephrology felt that the risks of the biopsy on a patient \r\nalready requiring heparin for DVT would outweigh the benefits \r\nwith the suspicion of ATN being high already. Urine output \r\nremained low prior to discharge, and tunneled HD line was placed \r\nfor longer-term access.\r\n\r\n# Respiratory Failure:\r\nPatient developed progressive hypoxemia from volume overload \r\neventually requiring CRRT with resolution of the same. However, \r\non ___ she had an unexplained hypoxemic respiratory episode \r\nwith persistent SpO2 measurements in the ___ despite NRB and NC; \r\nshe was intubated with ___ of continued O2 saturations in \r\nthe ___ before resolution not attributable to any particular \r\nintervention (nebs, suction, etc). This first hypoxemic episode \r\nwas attributed to aspiration though subsequent CXR and \r\nbronchoscopy were not impressive for evidence of the same. She \r\nwas extubated within 24hrs, but then reintubated in the setting \r\nof a break in her CRRT line that caused acute hypotension from \r\nblood loss (trapped in the CRRT circuit) and then hypoxemia. \r\nAfter restoration of hemodynamic stability and passing her RSBI, \r\nshe was again extubated, but re-intubated for nearly the same \r\nexact sequence of events that evening(break in the CRRT circuit \r\ndue to equipment failure; this has been reported and is being \r\ninvestigated). She was finally extubated on ___ and remains \r\noff supplemental O2 at time of MICU discharge. Antibiotics were \r\nempirically started in the setting of possible aspiration with \r\nleukocytosis (that could have been a stress reaction to \r\naspiration pneumonitis or intubations/exbuations); these will \r\nfinish on ___. She completed her course of antibiotics and \r\nremained afebrile and without respiratory distress the rest of \r\nher hospitalization. \r\n\r\n# Alcohol Abuse:\r\nPatient endorses heavy alcohol use. She was seen by social work \r\nwho gave resources, though patient is not interested in \r\ncounseling.\r\n\r\n# Severe Nutritional Deficiency:\r\nNutritional deficiencies including zinc and selenium requiring \r\nsignificant repletion. Repeat testing of zinc showed continued \r\nneed for repletion. Caloric needs and repletion addressed below.\r\n\r\n# Severe malnutrition: likely contributor to pancytopenia \r\nresulting from bone marrow suppression. Required tube feeding \r\ntube feed which was continued at discharge in order to meet her \r\ncaloric needs. She was initially found to aspirate thin liquids \r\nby a speech and swallow evaluation, however on reevaluation \r\nafter receiving tube feeds for some time, she was able to \r\ntolerate a regular diet and thin liquids. Her caloric intake by \r\nmouth was not sufficient to decrease tube feeds.\r\n\r\n# Hx Wernicke's Encephalopathy:\r\nPatient had waxing/waning mental status for much of her early \r\nhospital course which was initially attributed to delirium; \r\nhowever, for history of Wernicke's she was started on high-dose \r\nthiamine that seemed to improve her mental status. Nutrition was \r\nconsulted, and nutrition labs were sent that were all markedly \r\nlow. She was supplemented through her TFs and will need to \r\nremain on standing thiamine.\r\n\r\n# Deep Vein Thrombosis:\r\nPatient arrived to MICU with L femoral CVL; shortly thereafter, \r\nasymmetric R > L lower extremity swelling was noticed for which \r\n___ was obtained - this showed extensive venous clot burden in \r\nthe R lower extremity. IV heparin was started. Because of \r\npersistent thrombocytopenia, an IVC filter was placed, though \r\nbecause of her high clot risk IV heparin was continued. She \r\nshould have interval follow-up of her DVTs after discharge, as \r\nwell as scheduled follow-up with ___ for filter removal. She was \r\nmaintained on a heparin drip and should be bridged to Coumadin \r\nto follow up with hematology/oncology as an outpatient.\r\n \r\n# Concern for Gastrointestinal Bleed:\r\nAs described above, GI and Surgery were consulted early in her \r\nMICU stay for rising lactate and concern of gut ischemia in the \r\nsetting of her hypotension; flexible sigmoidoscopy was \r\nunimpressive and lactate improved with pressors and IVF. Near \r\nthe end of her FICU stay she had fresh blood coating a stool \r\nwhich raised concern for GIB; however, her Hct was stable, she \r\nwas HD stable, and guaiacs of subsequent stools were negative \r\nprior to MICU discharge. She underwent evaluation by Hepatology \r\nand EGD which showed no varices, negative colonoscopy. Capsule \r\nstudy failed, but patient's H/H stabilized and hepatology felt \r\nthe study could be done as an outpatient if necessary.\r\n\r\n**Transitional:**\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n-Patient will need daily assessment for hemodialysis needs, EPO \r\nwith HD given renal failure\r\n-Reassess nutritional status and continued need for tube \r\nfeeding, potential need for G-tube\r\n-Daily electrolytes and every other day CBC to evaluate need for \r\nblood transfusion\r\n-Patient on heparin gtt for DVT.

The mediastinal and hilar contours are \r\nnormal. The \r\npulmonary vasculature is normal. Lungs are clear.  No pleural \r\neffusion or \r\npneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  \r\nChain sutures are noted in the left upper quadrant of the \r\nabdomen. \r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\nNo acute cardiopulmonary abnormality \r\n\r\n___ CT abd/pelvis:\r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\n1. No active extravasation of contrast to suggest active GI \r\nbleeding at this time. \r\n2. Profound hepatic steatosis.  Enlarged periportal lymph nodes \r\nwith hazy \r\nmesentery and retroperitoneum likely reflect underlying liver \r\ndisease. \r\n3.  Colonic and rectal wall thickening which may reflect colitis \r\nversus portal colopathy.\r\n4. Heterogeneous appearance of the kidneys with possible \r\nstriated nephrograms. Correlate with urinalysis to exclude \r\npyelonephritis. \r\n\r\n___ TTE:\r\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are \r\nnormal (LVEF = 65%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal \r\nleft ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right \r\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The \r\ndiameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are \r\nnormal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal \r\nwith good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic \r\nregurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. \r\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly myxomatous. Frank mitral \r\nvalve prolapse is not seen but cannot be excluded with \r\ncertainty. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate \r\n(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature \r\nof the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly \r\nunderestimated (Coanda effect). There is borderline pulmonary \r\nartery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.  \r\n\r\n\r\n___ ___\r\nIMPRESSION:   \r\n1. Occlusive thrombus of all right lower extremity deep veins \r\nfrom the common femoral vein down to the calf veins. \r\n2. Patent left lower extremity veins. \r\n\r\n___ ECHO\r\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is \r\nnormal. LV systolic function appears depressed (LVEF = 40%) \r\nsecondary to hypokinesis of the basal two-thirds of the left \r\nventricle. The apical one-third of the left ventricle is \r\nhyperdynamic. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall \r\nmotion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, \r\nascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets \r\n(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No \r\naortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are \r\nmildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic \r\npressure is normal. The pulmonary artery is not well visualized. \r\nThere is no pericardial effusion. \r\n Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \r\nleft ventricular systolic dysfunction is now present. Findings \r\nsuggestive of stress cardiomyopathy with inverse Takotsubo \r\npattern of left ventricular contractile dysfunction.  \r\n\r\n___ CTH:\r\nIMPRESSION: \r\n1. There is mild progression of global cerebral atrophy since \r\nthe prior \r\nexamination of ___, greater than would be expected \r\nfor the \r\npatient's age. \r\n2. No intracranial hemorrhage or territorial infarct. \r\n\r\n___ LIVER US:\r\nIMPRESSION:    \r\n1.  Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of \r\nliver disease including steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, or \r\ncirrhosis cannot be excluded on the basis of this examination. \r\n2.  Trace ascites and small right pleural effusion. \r\n\r\n___ IVC filter placement:\r\nFINDINGS:   \r\n1. Patent normal sized, non-duplicated IVC with  no evidence of \r\na IVC \r\nthrombus. A small circumaortic renal vein originating from the \r\nIVC just above the bifurcation was noted however is very small \r\nin caliber and likely of no clinical significance. \r\n2. Successful deployment of an infra-renal retrievable IVC \r\nfilter. \r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\nSuccessful deployment of an infra-renal removable IVC filter. \r\n\r\n___ ECHO:\r\nConclusions   \r\n The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left \r\nventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular \r\nsystolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). Right ventricular \r\nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve \r\nleaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet \r\nexcursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The \r\nmitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral \r\nregurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary \r\nartery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a \r\ntrivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. \r\n IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved \r\nregional and low normal global biventricular systolic function. \r\nNo valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified. Trivial \r\npericardial effusion. \r\n\r\n___ Unilateral RLE veins \r\nIMPRESSION:    \r\nExtensive deep venous thrombosis involving the wall of the right \r\nlower \r\nextremity veins, overall similar to ___, but now with \r\nperhaps minimal flow in the distal right SFV. \r\n\r\n___ Video oropharyngeal swallow study\r\nAspiration with thin liquid consistency.\r\n\r\n___ Portable abdomen x-ray\r\nPatient is post gastric bypass surgery.  The Dobbhoff tube ends \r\nin the \r\nproximal jejunum. \r\n\r\n___ Renal ultrasound\r\nNo evidence of hydronephrosis.  Increased renal echogenicity \r\nconsistent with diffuse parenchymal renal disease.   \r\nSmall bilateral effusions and small to moderate volume ascites. \r\n\r\n___ - EGD\r\nDuodenum was not examined. Small gastric pouch consistent with \r\nRoux en y anatomy the blind limb and jejunal limb were both \r\nvisualized. No varices. Otherwise normal EGD to the jejunum.\r\n\r\n \r\nBrief Hospital Course:\r\n___ hx gastric bypass surgery, alcohol abuse complicated by \r\nWernicke's encephalopathy, concern for autonomic insufficiency, \r\npresented originally with hypotension, anemia and academia. Her \r\ncourse in the MICU was complicated by severe nutritional \r\ndeficiency, volume overload, renal failure, cardiomyopathy, \r\nhypoxemia and hypoxemic respiratory failure, and deep vein \r\nthrombosis.\r\n\r\n# Hypotension:\r\n# Cardiomyopathy: \r\n# Presumed alcoholic liver disease:\r\nPatient was given 4u PRBCs in the ED prior to FICU admission; \r\nher Hgb was stable for days afterward, and there was low \r\nsuspicion for active GIB initially in her MICU course. She was \r\nempirically antiobiosed for concern of sepsis, but no source was \r\nfound, and these antibiotics were held until a series of \r\npresumed aspiration events that will be discussed below. Morning \r\ncortisol was within normal limits twice; TSH was also within \r\nnormal limits. She underwent several echocardiograms to explain \r\nher persistent hypotension with pressor requirement that showed \r\nin sequence: mitral regurgitation with eccentric jet; inverse \r\nTakutsubo's cardiomyopathy; and then resolution of these issues. \r\nOf note, the resolution occurred after initiation of high-dose \r\nthiamine repletion, which may suggest an element of wet \r\nberiberbi from severe nutritional deficiency in the setting of \r\ngastric bypass and alcoholism. There was also strong suspicion \r\nof cirrhosis given her imaging and alcohol abuse history, for \r\nwhich she was started on midodrine. With these measures, she was \r\nsuccessfully weaned from pressors. Unresolved at the time of her \r\nMICU discharge was a question of autonomic insufficiency raised \r\nin her last Discharge Summary of ___ where it was thought her \r\nalcohol abuse could be contributing to baseline systolic \r\npressures in the ___. This in part resolved on the floor as the \r\npatient was weaned off midodrine and maintained systolic blood \r\npressure in the 100s.\r\n\r\n# Anemia: \r\n-Unexplained, possible GI source with lack of erythropoietin in \r\nthe setting of subacute renal failure . Patient had decreasing \r\npRBC transfusion requirements over the course of her stay, \r\nultimately needing 1U pRBC every 4 days. She was evaluated by \r\nHem/Onc who felt there was no evidence of significant hemolysis \r\nor malignancy and felt that there was an element of anemia of \r\nchronic inflammation, as well as decreased erythropoietin in the \r\nsetting of subacute renal failure. She was evaluated by GI who \r\nfound no source of bleed on sigmoidoscopy early in her course \r\nand no varices or bleeding on EGD. She had an episode of guaiac \r\npositive stool but had no significant bleeding on colonoscopy. \r\nPatient may benefit from outpatient capsule study if bleeding is \r\nongoing.\r\n\r\n# Thrombocytopenia: \r\nThere was no evidence of active bleed on presentation (stool \r\nnormal color, not tachycardic, no clinical or radiographic \r\nevidence of extravasation into a compartment). Surgery and GI \r\nwere consulted early in her MICU course for concern of ischemic \r\ngut in the setting of rising lactate, but flexible sigmoidoscopy \r\nwas negative for this and lactate resolved with fluid \r\nresuscitation. ___ Hematology consulted, and believe her \r\nanemia and thrombocytopenia are likely a combination of \r\nalcoholic bone marrow suppression, malnutrition and critical \r\nillness. She may benefit from a bone marrow biopsy when more \r\nstable; additionally, given her renal failure, she may have a \r\ndeveloping EPO deficiency. She was transfused by ED prior to \r\nMICU admission and did not require further blood products until \r\n___ (gradually dropping Hct attributed to anemia of chronic \r\nillness/inflammation/underproduction; she held her Hct each time \r\nafter transfusion).  \r\n\r\n# Diarrhea:\r\nNegative c. diff, improved over the course of the hospital stay. \r\nPossibly related to tube feeding formulas as this improved with \r\nchanging to a higher fiber formula and with the addition of \r\nbanana flakes. Recommend continued loperamide as needed and \r\noptimization of tube feeds in patient s/p gastric bypass.\r\n\r\n# Renal Failure (Addressed Separately Below):\r\nPresented with serum bicarbonate of 8 of unclear etiology. She \r\nmanifested diarrhea in the early part of her ICU stay (C diff \r\nassay negative, thought related to either alcohol abuse or early \r\ncourse of antibiotics administered empirically for presumed \r\nsepsis, resolved); her renal function markers may also have been \r\nunder-estimates of her true GFR given her nutritionally \r\ndeficient state. Acidemia corrected with bicarbonate drip, but \r\nrecurrence remains in a concern in the setting of her renal \r\nfailure with poor UOP. CRRT was started in the setting of volume \r\noverload in the ICU as described above, though she was noted to \r\nhave ATN by muddy brown casts in her urine as well as \r\npersistently poor UOP. At time of FICU discharge she is being \r\ntrialed off CRRT, though with her poor UOP she may need to be \r\ninitiated on standing dialysis. Upon transfer to the floor, her \r\nrenal function did not improve and she remained oliguric. She \r\nwas evaluated by nephrology who felt that ATN without renal \r\nrecovery was the most likely diagnosis based on her urine \r\nsediment and history. A renal biopsy was considered, but \r\nnephrology felt that the risks of the biopsy on a patient \r\nalready requiring heparin for DVT would outweigh the benefits \r\nwith the suspicion of ATN being high already. Urine output \r\nremained low prior to discharge, and tunneled HD line was placed \r\nfor longer-term access.\r\n\r\n# Respiratory Failure:\r\nPatient developed progressive hypoxemia from volume overload \r\neventually requiring CRRT with resolution of the same. However, \r\non ___ she had an unexplained hypoxemic respiratory episode \r\nwith persistent SpO2 measurements in the ___ despite NRB and NC; \r\nshe was intubated with ___ of continued O2 saturations in \r\nthe ___ before resolution not attributable to any particular \r\nintervention (nebs, suction, etc). This first hypoxemic episode \r\nwas attributed to aspiration though subsequent CXR and \r\nbronchoscopy were not impressive for evidence of the same. She \r\nwas extubated within 24hrs, but then reintubated in the setting \r\nof a break in her CRRT line that caused acute hypotension from \r\nblood loss (trapped in the CRRT circuit) and then hypoxemia. \r\nAfter restoration of hemodynamic stability and passing her RSBI, \r\nshe was again extubated, but re-intubated for nearly the same \r\nexact sequence of events that evening(break in the CRRT circuit \r\ndue to equipment failure; this has been reported and is being \r\ninvestigated). She was finally extubated on ___ and remains \r\noff supplemental O2 at time of MICU discharge. Antibiotics were \r\nempirically started in the setting of possible aspiration with \r\nleukocytosis (that could have been a stress reaction to \r\naspiration pneumonitis or intubations/exbuations); these will \r\nfinish on ___. She completed her course of antibiotics and \r\nremained afebrile and without respiratory distress the rest of \r\nher hospitalization. \r\n\r\n# Alcohol Abuse:\r\nPatient endorses heavy alcohol use. She was seen by social work \r\nwho gave resources, though patient is not interested in \r\ncounseling.\r\n\r\n# Severe Nutritional Deficiency:\r\nNutritional deficiencies including zinc and selenium requiring \r\nsignificant repletion. Repeat testing of zinc showed continued \r\nneed for repletion. Caloric needs and repletion addressed below.\r\n\r\n# Severe malnutrition: likely contributor to pancytopenia \r\nresulting from bone marrow suppression. Required tube feeding \r\ntube feed which was continued at discharge in order to meet her \r\ncaloric needs. She was initially found to aspirate thin liquids \r\nby a speech and swallow evaluation, however on reevaluation \r\nafter receiving tube feeds for some time, she was able to \r\ntolerate a regular diet and thin liquids. Her caloric intake by \r\nmouth was not sufficient to decrease tube feeds.\r\n\r\n# Hx Wernicke's Encephalopathy:\r\nPatient had waxing/waning mental status for much of her early \r\nhospital course which was initially attributed to delirium; \r\nhowever, for history of Wernicke's she was started on high-dose \r\nthiamine that seemed to improve her mental status. Nutrition was \r\nconsulted, and nutrition labs were sent that were all markedly \r\nlow. She was supplemented through her TFs and will need to \r\nremain on standing thiamine.\r\n\r\n# Deep Vein Thrombosis:\r\nPatient arrived to MICU with L femoral CVL; shortly thereafter, \r\nasymmetric R > L lower extremity swelling was noticed for which \r\n___ was obtained - this showed extensive venous clot burden in \r\nthe R lower extremity. IV heparin was started. Because of \r\npersistent thrombocytopenia, an IVC filter was placed, though \r\nbecause of her high clot risk IV heparin was continued. She \r\nshould have interval follow-up of her DVTs after discharge, as \r\nwell as scheduled follow-up with ___ for filter removal. She was \r\nmaintained on a heparin drip and should be bridged to Coumadin \r\nto follow up with hematology/oncology as an outpatient.\r\n \r\n# Concern for Gastrointestinal Bleed:\r\nAs described above, GI and Surgery were consulted early in her \r\nMICU stay for rising lactate and concern of gut ischemia in the \r\nsetting of her hypotension; flexible sigmoidoscopy was \r\nunimpressive and lactate improved with pressors and IVF. Near \r\nthe end of her FICU stay she had fresh blood coating a stool \r\nwhich raised concern for GIB; however, her Hct was stable, she \r\nwas HD stable, and guaiacs of subsequent stools were negative \r\nprior to MICU discharge. She underwent evaluation by Hepatology \r\nand EGD which showed no varices, negative colonoscopy. Capsule \r\nstudy failed, but patient's H/H stabilized and hepatology felt \r\nthe study could be done as an outpatient if necessary.\r\n\r\n**Transitional:**\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n-Patient will need daily assessment for hemodialysis needs, EPO \r\nwith HD given renal failure\r\n-Reassess nutritional status and continued need for tube \r\nfeeding, potential need for G-tube\r\n-Daily electrolytes and every other day CBC to evaluate need for \r\nblood transfusion\r\n-Patient on heparin gtt for DVT.

The mediastinal and hilar contours are \r\nnormal. The \r\npulmonary vasculature is normal. Lungs are clear.  No pleural \r\neffusion or \r\npneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  \r\nChain sutures are noted in the left upper quadrant of the \r\nabdomen. \r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\nNo acute cardiopulmonary abnormality \r\n\r\n___ CT abd/pelvis:\r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\n1. No active extravasation of contrast to suggest active GI \r\nbleeding at this time. \r\n2. Profound hepatic steatosis.  Enlarged periportal lymph nodes \r\nwith hazy \r\nmesentery and retroperitoneum likely reflect underlying liver \r\ndisease. \r\n3.  Colonic and rectal wall thickening which may reflect colitis \r\nversus portal colopathy.\r\n4. Heterogeneous appearance of the kidneys with possible \r\nstriated nephrograms. Correlate with urinalysis to exclude \r\npyelonephritis. \r\n\r\n___ TTE:\r\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are \r\nnormal (LVEF = 65%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal \r\nleft ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right \r\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The \r\ndiameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are \r\nnormal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal \r\nwith good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic \r\nregurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. \r\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly myxomatous. Frank mitral \r\nvalve prolapse is not seen but cannot be excluded with \r\ncertainty. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate \r\n(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature \r\nof the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly \r\nunderestimated (Coanda effect). There is borderline pulmonary \r\nartery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.  \r\n\r\n\r\n___ ___\r\nIMPRESSION:   \r\n1. Occlusive thrombus of all right lower extremity deep veins \r\nfrom the common femoral vein down to the calf veins. \r\n2. Patent left lower extremity veins. \r\n\r\n___ ECHO\r\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is \r\nnormal. LV systolic function appears depressed (LVEF = 40%) \r\nsecondary to hypokinesis of the basal two-thirds of the left \r\nventricle. The apical one-third of the left ventricle is \r\nhyperdynamic. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall \r\nmotion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, \r\nascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets \r\n(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No \r\naortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are \r\nmildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic \r\npressure is normal. The pulmonary artery is not well visualized. \r\nThere is no pericardial effusion. \r\n Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \r\nleft ventricular systolic dysfunction is now present. Findings \r\nsuggestive of stress cardiomyopathy with inverse Takotsubo \r\npattern of left ventricular contractile dysfunction.  \r\n\r\n___ CTH:\r\nIMPRESSION: \r\n1. There is mild progression of global cerebral atrophy since \r\nthe prior \r\nexamination of ___, greater than would be expected \r\nfor the \r\npatient's age. \r\n2. No intracranial hemorrhage or territorial infarct. \r\n\r\n___ LIVER US:\r\nIMPRESSION:    \r\n1.  Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of \r\nliver disease including steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, or \r\ncirrhosis cannot be excluded on the basis of this examination. \r\n2.  Trace ascites and small right pleural effusion. \r\n\r\n___ IVC filter placement:\r\nFINDINGS:   \r\n1. Patent normal sized, non-duplicated IVC with  no evidence of \r\na IVC \r\nthrombus. A small circumaortic renal vein originating from the \r\nIVC just above the bifurcation was noted however is very small \r\nin caliber and likely of no clinical significance. \r\n2. Successful deployment of an infra-renal retrievable IVC \r\nfilter. \r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\nSuccessful deployment of an infra-renal removable IVC filter. \r\n\r\n___ ECHO:\r\nConclusions   \r\n The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left \r\nventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular \r\nsystolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). Right ventricular \r\nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve \r\nleaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet \r\nexcursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The \r\nmitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral \r\nregurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary \r\nartery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a \r\ntrivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. \r\n IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved \r\nregional and low normal global biventricular systolic function. \r\nNo valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified. Trivial \r\npericardial effusion. \r\n\r\n___ Unilateral RLE veins \r\nIMPRESSION:    \r\nExtensive deep venous thrombosis involving the wall of the right \r\nlower \r\nextremity veins, overall similar to ___, but now with \r\nperhaps minimal flow in the distal right SFV. \r\n\r\n___ Video oropharyngeal swallow study\r\nAspiration with thin liquid consistency.\r\n\r\n___ Portable abdomen x-ray\r\nPatient is post gastric bypass surgery.  The Dobbhoff tube ends \r\nin the \r\nproximal jejunum. \r\n\r\n___ Renal ultrasound\r\nNo evidence of hydronephrosis.  Increased renal echogenicity \r\nconsistent with diffuse parenchymal renal disease.   \r\nSmall bilateral effusions and small to moderate volume ascites. \r\n\r\n___ - EGD\r\nDuodenum was not examined. Small gastric pouch consistent with \r\nRoux en y anatomy the blind limb and jejunal limb were both \r\nvisualized. No varices. Otherwise normal EGD to the jejunum.\r\n\r\n \r\nBrief Hospital Course:\r\n___ hx gastric bypass surgery, alcohol abuse complicated by \r\nWernicke's encephalopathy, concern for autonomic insufficiency, \r\npresented originally with hypotension, anemia and academia. Her \r\ncourse in the MICU was complicated by severe nutritional \r\ndeficiency, volume overload, renal failure, cardiomyopathy, \r\nhypoxemia and hypoxemic respiratory failure, and deep vein \r\nthrombosis.\r\n\r\n# Hypotension:\r\n# Cardiomyopathy: \r\n# Presumed alcoholic liver disease:\r\nPatient was given 4u PRBCs in the ED prior to FICU admission; \r\nher Hgb was stable for days afterward, and there was low \r\nsuspicion for active GIB initially in her MICU course. She was \r\nempirically antiobiosed for concern of sepsis, but no source was \r\nfound, and these antibiotics were held until a series of \r\npresumed aspiration events that will be discussed below. Morning \r\ncortisol was within normal limits twice; TSH was also within \r\nnormal limits. She underwent several echocardiograms to explain \r\nher persistent hypotension with pressor requirement that showed \r\nin sequence: mitral regurgitation with eccentric jet; inverse \r\nTakutsubo's cardiomyopathy; and then resolution of these issues. \r\nOf note, the resolution occurred after initiation of high-dose \r\nthiamine repletion, which may suggest an element of wet \r\nberiberbi from severe nutritional deficiency in the setting of \r\ngastric bypass and alcoholism. There was also strong suspicion \r\nof cirrhosis given her imaging and alcohol abuse history, for \r\nwhich she was started on midodrine. With these measures, she was \r\nsuccessfully weaned from pressors. Unresolved at the time of her \r\nMICU discharge was a question of autonomic insufficiency raised \r\nin her last Discharge Summary of ___ where it was thought her \r\nalcohol abuse could be contributing to baseline systolic \r\npressures in the ___. This in part resolved on the floor as the \r\npatient was weaned off midodrine and maintained systolic blood \r\npressure in the 100s.\r\n\r\n# Anemia: \r\n-Unexplained, possible GI source with lack of erythropoietin in \r\nthe setting of subacute renal failure . Patient had decreasing \r\npRBC transfusion requirements over the course of her stay, \r\nultimately needing 1U pRBC every 4 days. She was evaluated by \r\nHem/Onc who felt there was no evidence of significant hemolysis \r\nor malignancy and felt that there was an element of anemia of \r\nchronic inflammation, as well as decreased erythropoietin in the \r\nsetting of subacute renal failure. She was evaluated by GI who \r\nfound no source of bleed on sigmoidoscopy early in her course \r\nand no varices or bleeding on EGD. She had an episode of guaiac \r\npositive stool but had no significant bleeding on colonoscopy. \r\nPatient may benefit from outpatient capsule study if bleeding is \r\nongoing.\r\n\r\n# Thrombocytopenia: \r\nThere was no evidence of active bleed on presentation (stool \r\nnormal color, not tachycardic, no clinical or radiographic \r\nevidence of extravasation into a compartment). Surgery and GI \r\nwere consulted early in her MICU course for concern of ischemic \r\ngut in the setting of rising lactate, but flexible sigmoidoscopy \r\nwas negative for this and lactate resolved with fluid \r\nresuscitation. ___ Hematology consulted, and believe her \r\nanemia and thrombocytopenia are likely a combination of \r\nalcoholic bone marrow suppression, malnutrition and critical \r\nillness. She may benefit from a bone marrow biopsy when more \r\nstable; additionally, given her renal failure, she may have a \r\ndeveloping EPO deficiency. She was transfused by ED prior to \r\nMICU admission and did not require further blood products until \r\n___ (gradually dropping Hct attributed to anemia of chronic \r\nillness/inflammation/underproduction; she held her Hct each time \r\nafter transfusion).  \r\n\r\n# Diarrhea:\r\nNegative c. diff, improved over the course of the hospital stay. \r\nPossibly related to tube feeding formulas as this improved with \r\nchanging to a higher fiber formula and with the addition of \r\nbanana flakes. Recommend continued loperamide as needed and \r\noptimization of tube feeds in patient s/p gastric bypass.\r\n\r\n# Renal Failure (Addressed Separately Below):\r\nPresented with serum bicarbonate of 8 of unclear etiology. She \r\nmanifested diarrhea in the early part of her ICU stay (C diff \r\nassay negative, thought related to either alcohol abuse or early \r\ncourse of antibiotics administered empirically for presumed \r\nsepsis, resolved); her renal function markers may also have been \r\nunder-estimates of her true GFR given her nutritionally \r\ndeficient state. Acidemia corrected with bicarbonate drip, but \r\nrecurrence remains in a concern in the setting of her renal \r\nfailure with poor UOP. CRRT was started in the setting of volume \r\noverload in the ICU as described above, though she was noted to \r\nhave ATN by muddy brown casts in her urine as well as \r\npersistently poor UOP. At time of FICU discharge she is being \r\ntrialed off CRRT, though with her poor UOP she may need to be \r\ninitiated on standing dialysis. Upon transfer to the floor, her \r\nrenal function did not improve and she remained oliguric. She \r\nwas evaluated by nephrology who felt that ATN without renal \r\nrecovery was the most likely diagnosis based on her urine \r\nsediment and history. A renal biopsy was considered, but \r\nnephrology felt that the risks of the biopsy on a patient \r\nalready requiring heparin for DVT would outweigh the benefits \r\nwith the suspicion of ATN being high already. Urine output \r\nremained low prior to discharge, and tunneled HD line was placed \r\nfor longer-term access.\r\n\r\n# Respiratory Failure:\r\nPatient developed progressive hypoxemia from volume overload \r\neventually requiring CRRT with resolution of the same. However, \r\non ___ she had an unexplained hypoxemic respiratory episode \r\nwith persistent SpO2 measurements in the ___ despite NRB and NC; \r\nshe was intubated with ___ of continued O2 saturations in \r\nthe ___ before resolution not attributable to any particular \r\nintervention (nebs, suction, etc). This first hypoxemic episode \r\nwas attributed to aspiration though subsequent CXR and \r\nbronchoscopy were not impressive for evidence of the same. She \r\nwas extubated within 24hrs, but then reintubated in the setting \r\nof a break in her CRRT line that caused acute hypotension from \r\nblood loss (trapped in the CRRT circuit) and then hypoxemia. \r\nAfter restoration of hemodynamic stability and passing her RSBI, \r\nshe was again extubated, but re-intubated for nearly the same \r\nexact sequence of events that evening(break in the CRRT circuit \r\ndue to equipment failure; this has been reported and is being \r\ninvestigated). She was finally extubated on ___ and remains \r\noff supplemental O2 at time of MICU discharge. Antibiotics were \r\nempirically started in the setting of possible aspiration with \r\nleukocytosis (that could have been a stress reaction to \r\naspiration pneumonitis or intubations/exbuations); these will \r\nfinish on ___. She completed her course of antibiotics and \r\nremained afebrile and without respiratory distress the rest of \r\nher hospitalization. \r\n\r\n# Alcohol Abuse:\r\nPatient endorses heavy alcohol use. She was seen by social work \r\nwho gave resources, though patient is not interested in \r\ncounseling.\r\n\r\n# Severe Nutritional Deficiency:\r\nNutritional deficiencies including zinc and selenium requiring \r\nsignificant repletion. Repeat testing of zinc showed continued \r\nneed for repletion. Caloric needs and repletion addressed below.\r\n\r\n# Severe malnutrition: likely contributor to pancytopenia \r\nresulting from bone marrow suppression. Required tube feeding \r\ntube feed which was continued at discharge in order to meet her \r\ncaloric needs. She was initially found to aspirate thin liquids \r\nby a speech and swallow evaluation, however on reevaluation \r\nafter receiving tube feeds for some time, she was able to \r\ntolerate a regular diet and thin liquids. Her caloric intake by \r\nmouth was not sufficient to decrease tube feeds.\r\n\r\n# Hx Wernicke's Encephalopathy:\r\nPatient had waxing/waning mental status for much of her early \r\nhospital course which was initially attributed to delirium; \r\nhowever, for history of Wernicke's she was started on high-dose \r\nthiamine that seemed to improve her mental status. Nutrition was \r\nconsulted, and nutrition labs were sent that were all markedly \r\nlow. She was supplemented through her TFs and will need to \r\nremain on standing thiamine.\r\n\r\n# Deep Vein Thrombosis:\r\nPatient arrived to MICU with L femoral CVL; shortly thereafter, \r\nasymmetric R > L lower extremity swelling was noticed for which \r\n___ was obtained - this showed extensive venous clot burden in \r\nthe R lower extremity. IV heparin was started. Because of \r\npersistent thrombocytopenia, an IVC filter was placed, though \r\nbecause of her high clot risk IV heparin was continued. She \r\nshould have interval follow-up of her DVTs after discharge, as \r\nwell as scheduled follow-up with ___ for filter removal. She was \r\nmaintained on a heparin drip and should be bridged to Coumadin \r\nto follow up with hematology/oncology as an outpatient.\r\n \r\n# Concern for Gastrointestinal Bleed:\r\nAs described above, GI and Surgery were consulted early in her \r\nMICU stay for rising lactate and concern of gut ischemia in the \r\nsetting of her hypotension; flexible sigmoidoscopy was \r\nunimpressive and lactate improved with pressors and IVF. Near \r\nthe end of her FICU stay she had fresh blood coating a stool \r\nwhich raised concern for GIB; however, her Hct was stable, she \r\nwas HD stable, and guaiacs of subsequent stools were negative \r\nprior to MICU discharge. She underwent evaluation by Hepatology \r\nand EGD which showed no varices, negative colonoscopy. Capsule \r\nstudy failed, but patient's H/H stabilized and hepatology felt \r\nthe study could be done as an outpatient if necessary.\r\n\r\n**Transitional:**\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n-Patient will need daily assessment for hemodialysis needs, EPO \r\nwith HD given renal failure\r\n-Reassess nutritional status and continued need for tube \r\nfeeding, potential need for G-tube\r\n-Daily electrolytes and every other day CBC to evaluate need for \r\nblood transfusion\r\n-Patient on heparin gtt for DVT.

The mediastinal and hilar contours are \r\nnormal. The \r\npulmonary vasculature is normal. Lungs are clear.  No pleural \r\neffusion or \r\npneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  \r\nChain sutures are noted in the left upper quadrant of the \r\nabdomen. \r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\nNo acute cardiopulmonary abnormality \r\n\r\n___ CT abd/pelvis:\r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\n1. No active extravasation of contrast to suggest active GI \r\nbleeding at this time. \r\n2. Profound hepatic steatosis.  Enlarged periportal lymph nodes \r\nwith hazy \r\nmesentery and retroperitoneum likely reflect underlying liver \r\ndisease. \r\n3.  Colonic and rectal wall thickening which may reflect colitis \r\nversus portal colopathy.\r\n4. Heterogeneous appearance of the kidneys with possible \r\nstriated nephrograms. Correlate with urinalysis to exclude \r\npyelonephritis. \r\n\r\n___ TTE:\r\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are \r\nnormal (LVEF = 65%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal \r\nleft ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right \r\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The \r\ndiameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are \r\nnormal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal \r\nwith good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic \r\nregurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. \r\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly myxomatous. Frank mitral \r\nvalve prolapse is not seen but cannot be excluded with \r\ncertainty. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate \r\n(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature \r\nof the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly \r\nunderestimated (Coanda effect). There is borderline pulmonary \r\nartery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.  \r\n\r\n\r\n___ ___\r\nIMPRESSION:   \r\n1. Occlusive thrombus of all right lower extremity deep veins \r\nfrom the common femoral vein down to the calf veins. \r\n2. Patent left lower extremity veins. \r\n\r\n___ ECHO\r\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is \r\nnormal. LV systolic function appears depressed (LVEF = 40%) \r\nsecondary to hypokinesis of the basal two-thirds of the left \r\nventricle. The apical one-third of the left ventricle is \r\nhyperdynamic. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall \r\nmotion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, \r\nascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets \r\n(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No \r\naortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are \r\nmildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic \r\npressure is normal. The pulmonary artery is not well visualized. \r\nThere is no pericardial effusion. \r\n Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \r\nleft ventricular systolic dysfunction is now present. Findings \r\nsuggestive of stress cardiomyopathy with inverse Takotsubo \r\npattern of left ventricular contractile dysfunction.  \r\n\r\n___ CTH:\r\nIMPRESSION: \r\n1. There is mild progression of global cerebral atrophy since \r\nthe prior \r\nexamination of ___, greater than would be expected \r\nfor the \r\npatient's age. \r\n2. No intracranial hemorrhage or territorial infarct. \r\n\r\n___ LIVER US:\r\nIMPRESSION:    \r\n1.  Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of \r\nliver disease including steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, or \r\ncirrhosis cannot be excluded on the basis of this examination. \r\n2.  Trace ascites and small right pleural effusion. \r\n\r\n___ IVC filter placement:\r\nFINDINGS:   \r\n1. Patent normal sized, non-duplicated IVC with  no evidence of \r\na IVC \r\nthrombus. A small circumaortic renal vein originating from the \r\nIVC just above the bifurcation was noted however is very small \r\nin caliber and likely of no clinical significance. \r\n2. Successful deployment of an infra-renal retrievable IVC \r\nfilter. \r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\nSuccessful deployment of an infra-renal removable IVC filter. \r\n\r\n___ ECHO:\r\nConclusions   \r\n The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left \r\nventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular \r\nsystolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). Right ventricular \r\nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve \r\nleaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet \r\nexcursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The \r\nmitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral \r\nregurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary \r\nartery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a \r\ntrivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. \r\n IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved \r\nregional and low normal global biventricular systolic function. \r\nNo valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified. Trivial \r\npericardial effusion. \r\n\r\n___ Unilateral RLE veins \r\nIMPRESSION:    \r\nExtensive deep venous thrombosis involving the wall of the right \r\nlower \r\nextremity veins, overall similar to ___, but now with \r\nperhaps minimal flow in the distal right SFV. \r\n\r\n___ Video oropharyngeal swallow study\r\nAspiration with thin liquid consistency.\r\n\r\n___ Portable abdomen x-ray\r\nPatient is post gastric bypass surgery.  The Dobbhoff tube ends \r\nin the \r\nproximal jejunum. \r\n\r\n___ Renal ultrasound\r\nNo evidence of hydronephrosis.  Increased renal echogenicity \r\nconsistent with diffuse parenchymal renal disease.   \r\nSmall bilateral effusions and small to moderate volume ascites. \r\n\r\n___ - EGD\r\nDuodenum was not examined. Small gastric pouch consistent with \r\nRoux en y anatomy the blind limb and jejunal limb were both \r\nvisualized. No varices. Otherwise normal EGD to the jejunum.\r\n\r\n \r\nBrief Hospital Course:\r\n___ hx gastric bypass surgery, alcohol abuse complicated by \r\nWernicke's encephalopathy, concern for autonomic insufficiency, \r\npresented originally with hypotension, anemia and academia. Her \r\ncourse in the MICU was complicated by severe nutritional \r\ndeficiency, volume overload, renal failure, cardiomyopathy, \r\nhypoxemia and hypoxemic respiratory failure, and deep vein \r\nthrombosis.\r\n\r\n# Hypotension:\r\n# Cardiomyopathy: \r\n# Presumed alcoholic liver disease:\r\nPatient was given 4u PRBCs in the ED prior to FICU admission; \r\nher Hgb was stable for days afterward, and there was low \r\nsuspicion for active GIB initially in her MICU course. She was \r\nempirically antiobiosed for concern of sepsis, but no source was \r\nfound, and these antibiotics were held until a series of \r\npresumed aspiration events that will be discussed below. Morning \r\ncortisol was within normal limits twice; TSH was also within \r\nnormal limits. She underwent several echocardiograms to explain \r\nher persistent hypotension with pressor requirement that showed \r\nin sequence: mitral regurgitation with eccentric jet; inverse \r\nTakutsubo's cardiomyopathy; and then resolution of these issues. \r\nOf note, the resolution occurred after initiation of high-dose \r\nthiamine repletion, which may suggest an element of wet \r\nberiberbi from severe nutritional deficiency in the setting of \r\ngastric bypass and alcoholism. There was also strong suspicion \r\nof cirrhosis given her imaging and alcohol abuse history, for \r\nwhich she was started on midodrine. With these measures, she was \r\nsuccessfully weaned from pressors. Unresolved at the time of her \r\nMICU discharge was a question of autonomic insufficiency raised \r\nin her last Discharge Summary of ___ where it was thought her \r\nalcohol abuse could be contributing to baseline systolic \r\npressures in the ___. This in part resolved on the floor as the \r\npatient was weaned off midodrine and maintained systolic blood \r\npressure in the 100s.\r\n\r\n# Anemia: \r\n-Unexplained, possible GI source with lack of erythropoietin in \r\nthe setting of subacute renal failure . Patient had decreasing \r\npRBC transfusion requirements over the course of her stay, \r\nultimately needing 1U pRBC every 4 days. She was evaluated by \r\nHem/Onc who felt there was no evidence of significant hemolysis \r\nor malignancy and felt that there was an element of anemia of \r\nchronic inflammation, as well as decreased erythropoietin in the \r\nsetting of subacute renal failure. She was evaluated by GI who \r\nfound no source of bleed on sigmoidoscopy early in her course \r\nand no varices or bleeding on EGD. She had an episode of guaiac \r\npositive stool but had no significant bleeding on colonoscopy. \r\nPatient may benefit from outpatient capsule study if bleeding is \r\nongoing.\r\n\r\n# Thrombocytopenia: \r\nThere was no evidence of active bleed on presentation (stool \r\nnormal color, not tachycardic, no clinical or radiographic \r\nevidence of extravasation into a compartment). Surgery and GI \r\nwere consulted early in her MICU course for concern of ischemic \r\ngut in the setting of rising lactate, but flexible sigmoidoscopy \r\nwas negative for this and lactate resolved with fluid \r\nresuscitation. ___ Hematology consulted, and believe her \r\nanemia and thrombocytopenia are likely a combination of \r\nalcoholic bone marrow suppression, malnutrition and critical \r\nillness. She may benefit from a bone marrow biopsy when more \r\nstable; additionally, given her renal failure, she may have a \r\ndeveloping EPO deficiency. She was transfused by ED prior to \r\nMICU admission and did not require further blood products until \r\n___ (gradually dropping Hct attributed to anemia of chronic \r\nillness/inflammation/underproduction; she held her Hct each time \r\nafter transfusion).  \r\n\r\n# Diarrhea:\r\nNegative c. diff, improved over the course of the hospital stay. \r\nPossibly related to tube feeding formulas as this improved with \r\nchanging to a higher fiber formula and with the addition of \r\nbanana flakes. Recommend continued loperamide as needed and \r\noptimization of tube feeds in patient s/p gastric bypass.\r\n\r\n# Renal Failure (Addressed Separately Below):\r\nPresented with serum bicarbonate of 8 of unclear etiology. She \r\nmanifested diarrhea in the early part of her ICU stay (C diff \r\nassay negative, thought related to either alcohol abuse or early \r\ncourse of antibiotics administered empirically for presumed \r\nsepsis, resolved); her renal function markers may also have been \r\nunder-estimates of her true GFR given her nutritionally \r\ndeficient state. Acidemia corrected with bicarbonate drip, but \r\nrecurrence remains in a concern in the setting of her renal \r\nfailure with poor UOP. CRRT was started in the setting of volume \r\noverload in the ICU as described above, though she was noted to \r\nhave ATN by muddy brown casts in her urine as well as \r\npersistently poor UOP. At time of FICU discharge she is being \r\ntrialed off CRRT, though with her poor UOP she may need to be \r\ninitiated on standing dialysis. Upon transfer to the floor, her \r\nrenal function did not improve and she remained oliguric. She \r\nwas evaluated by nephrology who felt that ATN without renal \r\nrecovery was the most likely diagnosis based on her urine \r\nsediment and history. A renal biopsy was considered, but \r\nnephrology felt that the risks of the biopsy on a patient \r\nalready requiring heparin for DVT would outweigh the benefits \r\nwith the suspicion of ATN being high already. Urine output \r\nremained low prior to discharge, and tunneled HD line was placed \r\nfor longer-term access.\r\n\r\n# Respiratory Failure:\r\nPatient developed progressive hypoxemia from volume overload \r\neventually requiring CRRT with resolution of the same. However, \r\non ___ she had an unexplained hypoxemic respiratory episode \r\nwith persistent SpO2 measurements in the ___ despite NRB and NC; \r\nshe was intubated with ___ of continued O2 saturations in \r\nthe ___ before resolution not attributable to any particular \r\nintervention (nebs, suction, etc). This first hypoxemic episode \r\nwas attributed to aspiration though subsequent CXR and \r\nbronchoscopy were not impressive for evidence of the same. She \r\nwas extubated within 24hrs, but then reintubated in the setting \r\nof a break in her CRRT line that caused acute hypotension from \r\nblood loss (trapped in the CRRT circuit) and then hypoxemia. \r\nAfter restoration of hemodynamic stability and passing her RSBI, \r\nshe was again extubated, but re-intubated for nearly the same \r\nexact sequence of events that evening(break in the CRRT circuit \r\ndue to equipment failure; this has been reported and is being \r\ninvestigated). She was finally extubated on ___ and remains \r\noff supplemental O2 at time of MICU discharge. Antibiotics were \r\nempirically started in the setting of possible aspiration with \r\nleukocytosis (that could have been a stress reaction to \r\naspiration pneumonitis or intubations/exbuations); these will \r\nfinish on ___. She completed her course of antibiotics and \r\nremained afebrile and without respiratory distress the rest of \r\nher hospitalization. \r\n\r\n# Alcohol Abuse:\r\nPatient endorses heavy alcohol use. She was seen by social work \r\nwho gave resources, though patient is not interested in \r\ncounseling.\r\n\r\n# Severe Nutritional Deficiency:\r\nNutritional deficiencies including zinc and selenium requiring \r\nsignificant repletion. Repeat testing of zinc showed continued \r\nneed for repletion. Caloric needs and repletion addressed below.\r\n\r\n# Severe malnutrition: likely contributor to pancytopenia \r\nresulting from bone marrow suppression. Required tube feeding \r\ntube feed which was continued at discharge in order to meet her \r\ncaloric needs. She was initially found to aspirate thin liquids \r\nby a speech and swallow evaluation, however on reevaluation \r\nafter receiving tube feeds for some time, she was able to \r\ntolerate a regular diet and thin liquids. Her caloric intake by \r\nmouth was not sufficient to decrease tube feeds.\r\n\r\n# Hx Wernicke's Encephalopathy:\r\nPatient had waxing/waning mental status for much of her early \r\nhospital course which was initially attributed to delirium; \r\nhowever, for history of Wernicke's she was started on high-dose \r\nthiamine that seemed to improve her mental status. Nutrition was \r\nconsulted, and nutrition labs were sent that were all markedly \r\nlow. She was supplemented through her TFs and will need to \r\nremain on standing thiamine.\r\n\r\n# Deep Vein Thrombosis:\r\nPatient arrived to MICU with L femoral CVL; shortly thereafter, \r\nasymmetric R > L lower extremity swelling was noticed for which \r\n___ was obtained - this showed extensive venous clot burden in \r\nthe R lower extremity. IV heparin was started. Because of \r\npersistent thrombocytopenia, an IVC filter was placed, though \r\nbecause of her high clot risk IV heparin was continued. She \r\nshould have interval follow-up of her DVTs after discharge, as \r\nwell as scheduled follow-up with ___ for filter removal. She was \r\nmaintained on a heparin drip and should be bridged to Coumadin \r\nto follow up with hematology/oncology as an outpatient.\r\n \r\n# Concern for Gastrointestinal Bleed:\r\nAs described above, GI and Surgery were consulted early in her \r\nMICU stay for rising lactate and concern of gut ischemia in the \r\nsetting of her hypotension; flexible sigmoidoscopy was \r\nunimpressive and lactate improved with pressors and IVF. Near \r\nthe end of her FICU stay she had fresh blood coating a stool \r\nwhich raised concern for GIB; however, her Hct was stable, she \r\nwas HD stable, and guaiacs of subsequent stools were negative \r\nprior to MICU discharge. She underwent evaluation by Hepatology \r\nand EGD which showed no varices, negative colonoscopy. Capsule \r\nstudy failed, but patient's H/H stabilized and hepatology felt \r\nthe study could be done as an outpatient if necessary.\r\n\r\n**Transitional:**\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n-Patient will need daily assessment for hemodialysis needs, EPO \r\nwith HD given renal failure\r\n-Reassess nutritional status and continued need for tube \r\nfeeding, potential need for G-tube\r\n-Daily electrolytes and every other day CBC to evaluate need for \r\nblood transfusion\r\n-Patient on heparin gtt for DVT.

The mediastinal and hilar contours are \r\nnormal. The \r\npulmonary vasculature is normal. Lungs are clear.  No pleural \r\neffusion or \r\npneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  \r\nChain sutures are noted in the left upper quadrant of the \r\nabdomen. \r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\nNo acute cardiopulmonary abnormality \r\n\r\n___ CT abd/pelvis:\r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\n1. No active extravasation of contrast to suggest active GI \r\nbleeding at this time. \r\n2. Profound hepatic steatosis.  Enlarged periportal lymph nodes \r\nwith hazy \r\nmesentery and retroperitoneum likely reflect underlying liver \r\ndisease. \r\n3.  Colonic and rectal wall thickening which may reflect colitis \r\nversus portal colopathy.\r\n4. Heterogeneous appearance of the kidneys with possible \r\nstriated nephrograms. Correlate with urinalysis to exclude \r\npyelonephritis. \r\n\r\n___ TTE:\r\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are \r\nnormal (LVEF = 65%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal \r\nleft ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right \r\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The \r\ndiameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are \r\nnormal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal \r\nwith good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic \r\nregurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. \r\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly myxomatous. Frank mitral \r\nvalve prolapse is not seen but cannot be excluded with \r\ncertainty. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate \r\n(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature \r\nof the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly \r\nunderestimated (Coanda effect). There is borderline pulmonary \r\nartery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.  \r\n\r\n\r\n___ ___\r\nIMPRESSION:   \r\n1. Occlusive thrombus of all right lower extremity deep veins \r\nfrom the common femoral vein down to the calf veins. \r\n2. Patent left lower extremity veins. \r\n\r\n___ ECHO\r\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is \r\nnormal. LV systolic function appears depressed (LVEF = 40%) \r\nsecondary to hypokinesis of the basal two-thirds of the left \r\nventricle. The apical one-third of the left ventricle is \r\nhyperdynamic. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall \r\nmotion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, \r\nascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets \r\n(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No \r\naortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are \r\nmildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic \r\npressure is normal. The pulmonary artery is not well visualized. \r\nThere is no pericardial effusion. \r\n Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \r\nleft ventricular systolic dysfunction is now present. Findings \r\nsuggestive of stress cardiomyopathy with inverse Takotsubo \r\npattern of left ventricular contractile dysfunction.  \r\n\r\n___ CTH:\r\nIMPRESSION: \r\n1. There is mild progression of global cerebral atrophy since \r\nthe prior \r\nexamination of ___, greater than would be expected \r\nfor the \r\npatient's age. \r\n2. No intracranial hemorrhage or territorial infarct. \r\n\r\n___ LIVER US:\r\nIMPRESSION:    \r\n1.  Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of \r\nliver disease including steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, or \r\ncirrhosis cannot be excluded on the basis of this examination. \r\n2.  Trace ascites and small right pleural effusion. \r\n\r\n___ IVC filter placement:\r\nFINDINGS:   \r\n1. Patent normal sized, non-duplicated IVC with  no evidence of \r\na IVC \r\nthrombus. A small circumaortic renal vein originating from the \r\nIVC just above the bifurcation was noted however is very small \r\nin caliber and likely of no clinical significance. \r\n2. Successful deployment of an infra-renal retrievable IVC \r\nfilter. \r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\nSuccessful deployment of an infra-renal removable IVC filter. \r\n\r\n___ ECHO:\r\nConclusions   \r\n The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left \r\nventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular \r\nsystolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). Right ventricular \r\nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve \r\nleaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet \r\nexcursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The \r\nmitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral \r\nregurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary \r\nartery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a \r\ntrivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. \r\n IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved \r\nregional and low normal global biventricular systolic function. \r\nNo valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified. Trivial \r\npericardial effusion. \r\n\r\n___ Unilateral RLE veins \r\nIMPRESSION:    \r\nExtensive deep venous thrombosis involving the wall of the right \r\nlower \r\nextremity veins, overall similar to ___, but now with \r\nperhaps minimal flow in the distal right SFV. \r\n\r\n___ Video oropharyngeal swallow study\r\nAspiration with thin liquid consistency.\r\n\r\n___ Portable abdomen x-ray\r\nPatient is post gastric bypass surgery.  The Dobbhoff tube ends \r\nin the \r\nproximal jejunum. \r\n\r\n___ Renal ultrasound\r\nNo evidence of hydronephrosis.  Increased renal echogenicity \r\nconsistent with diffuse parenchymal renal disease.   \r\nSmall bilateral effusions and small to moderate volume ascites. \r\n\r\n___ - EGD\r\nDuodenum was not examined. Small gastric pouch consistent with \r\nRoux en y anatomy the blind limb and jejunal limb were both \r\nvisualized. No varices. Otherwise normal EGD to the jejunum.\r\n\r\n \r\nBrief Hospital Course:\r\n___ hx gastric bypass surgery, alcohol abuse complicated by \r\nWernicke's encephalopathy, concern for autonomic insufficiency, \r\npresented originally with hypotension, anemia and academia. Her \r\ncourse in the MICU was complicated by severe nutritional \r\ndeficiency, volume overload, renal failure, cardiomyopathy, \r\nhypoxemia and hypoxemic respiratory failure, and deep vein \r\nthrombosis.\r\n\r\n# Hypotension:\r\n# Cardiomyopathy: \r\n# Presumed alcoholic liver disease:\r\nPatient was given 4u PRBCs in the ED prior to FICU admission; \r\nher Hgb was stable for days afterward, and there was low \r\nsuspicion for active GIB initially in her MICU course. She was \r\nempirically antiobiosed for concern of sepsis, but no source was \r\nfound, and these antibiotics were held until a series of \r\npresumed aspiration events that will be discussed below. Morning \r\ncortisol was within normal limits twice; TSH was also within \r\nnormal limits. She underwent several echocardiograms to explain \r\nher persistent hypotension with pressor requirement that showed \r\nin sequence: mitral regurgitation with eccentric jet; inverse \r\nTakutsubo's cardiomyopathy; and then resolution of these issues. \r\nOf note, the resolution occurred after initiation of high-dose \r\nthiamine repletion, which may suggest an element of wet \r\nberiberbi from severe nutritional deficiency in the setting of \r\ngastric bypass and alcoholism. There was also strong suspicion \r\nof cirrhosis given her imaging and alcohol abuse history, for \r\nwhich she was started on midodrine. With these measures, she was \r\nsuccessfully weaned from pressors. Unresolved at the time of her \r\nMICU discharge was a question of autonomic insufficiency raised \r\nin her last Discharge Summary of ___ where it was thought her \r\nalcohol abuse could be contributing to baseline systolic \r\npressures in the ___. This in part resolved on the floor as the \r\npatient was weaned off midodrine and maintained systolic blood \r\npressure in the 100s.\r\n\r\n# Anemia: \r\n-Unexplained, possible GI source with lack of erythropoietin in \r\nthe setting of subacute renal failure . Patient had decreasing \r\npRBC transfusion requirements over the course of her stay, \r\nultimately needing 1U pRBC every 4 days. She was evaluated by \r\nHem/Onc who felt there was no evidence of significant hemolysis \r\nor malignancy and felt that there was an element of anemia of \r\nchronic inflammation, as well as decreased erythropoietin in the \r\nsetting of subacute renal failure. She was evaluated by GI who \r\nfound no source of bleed on sigmoidoscopy early in her course \r\nand no varices or bleeding on EGD. She had an episode of guaiac \r\npositive stool but had no significant bleeding on colonoscopy. \r\nPatient may benefit from outpatient capsule study if bleeding is \r\nongoing.\r\n\r\n# Thrombocytopenia: \r\nThere was no evidence of active bleed on presentation (stool \r\nnormal color, not tachycardic, no clinical or radiographic \r\nevidence of extravasation into a compartment). Surgery and GI \r\nwere consulted early in her MICU course for concern of ischemic \r\ngut in the setting of rising lactate, but flexible sigmoidoscopy \r\nwas negative for this and lactate resolved with fluid \r\nresuscitation. ___ Hematology consulted, and believe her \r\nanemia and thrombocytopenia are likely a combination of \r\nalcoholic bone marrow suppression, malnutrition and critical \r\nillness. She may benefit from a bone marrow biopsy when more \r\nstable; additionally, given her renal failure, she may have a \r\ndeveloping EPO deficiency. She was transfused by ED prior to \r\nMICU admission and did not require further blood products until \r\n___ (gradually dropping Hct attributed to anemia of chronic \r\nillness/inflammation/underproduction; she held her Hct each time \r\nafter transfusion).  \r\n\r\n# Diarrhea:\r\nNegative c. diff, improved over the course of the hospital stay. \r\nPossibly related to tube feeding formulas as this improved with \r\nchanging to a higher fiber formula and with the addition of \r\nbanana flakes. Recommend continued loperamide as needed and \r\noptimization of tube feeds in patient s/p gastric bypass.\r\n\r\n# Renal Failure (Addressed Separately Below):\r\nPresented with serum bicarbonate of 8 of unclear etiology. She \r\nmanifested diarrhea in the early part of her ICU stay (C diff \r\nassay negative, thought related to either alcohol abuse or early \r\ncourse of antibiotics administered empirically for presumed \r\nsepsis, resolved); her renal function markers may also have been \r\nunder-estimates of her true GFR given her nutritionally \r\ndeficient state. Acidemia corrected with bicarbonate drip, but \r\nrecurrence remains in a concern in the setting of her renal \r\nfailure with poor UOP. CRRT was started in the setting of volume \r\noverload in the ICU as described above, though she was noted to \r\nhave ATN by muddy brown casts in her urine as well as \r\npersistently poor UOP. At time of FICU discharge she is being \r\ntrialed off CRRT, though with her poor UOP she may need to be \r\ninitiated on standing dialysis. Upon transfer to the floor, her \r\nrenal function did not improve and she remained oliguric. She \r\nwas evaluated by nephrology who felt that ATN without renal \r\nrecovery was the most likely diagnosis based on her urine \r\nsediment and history. A renal biopsy was considered, but \r\nnephrology felt that the risks of the biopsy on a patient \r\nalready requiring heparin for DVT would outweigh the benefits \r\nwith the suspicion of ATN being high already. Urine output \r\nremained low prior to discharge, and tunneled HD line was placed \r\nfor longer-term access.\r\n\r\n# Respiratory Failure:\r\nPatient developed progressive hypoxemia from volume overload \r\neventually requiring CRRT with resolution of the same. However, \r\non ___ she had an unexplained hypoxemic respiratory episode \r\nwith persistent SpO2 measurements in the ___ despite NRB and NC; \r\nshe was intubated with ___ of continued O2 saturations in \r\nthe ___ before resolution not attributable to any particular \r\nintervention (nebs, suction, etc). This first hypoxemic episode \r\nwas attributed to aspiration though subsequent CXR and \r\nbronchoscopy were not impressive for evidence of the same. She \r\nwas extubated within 24hrs, but then reintubated in the setting \r\nof a break in her CRRT line that caused acute hypotension from \r\nblood loss (trapped in the CRRT circuit) and then hypoxemia. \r\nAfter restoration of hemodynamic stability and passing her RSBI, \r\nshe was again extubated, but re-intubated for nearly the same \r\nexact sequence of events that evening(break in the CRRT circuit \r\ndue to equipment failure; this has been reported and is being \r\ninvestigated). She was finally extubated on ___ and remains \r\noff supplemental O2 at time of MICU discharge. Antibiotics were \r\nempirically started in the setting of possible aspiration with \r\nleukocytosis (that could have been a stress reaction to \r\naspiration pneumonitis or intubations/exbuations); these will \r\nfinish on ___. She completed her course of antibiotics and \r\nremained afebrile and without respiratory distress the rest of \r\nher hospitalization. \r\n\r\n# Alcohol Abuse:\r\nPatient endorses heavy alcohol use. She was seen by social work \r\nwho gave resources, though patient is not interested in \r\ncounseling.\r\n\r\n# Severe Nutritional Deficiency:\r\nNutritional deficiencies including zinc and selenium requiring \r\nsignificant repletion. Repeat testing of zinc showed continued \r\nneed for repletion. Caloric needs and repletion addressed below.\r\n\r\n# Severe malnutrition: likely contributor to pancytopenia \r\nresulting from bone marrow suppression. Required tube feeding \r\ntube feed which was continued at discharge in order to meet her \r\ncaloric needs. She was initially found to aspirate thin liquids \r\nby a speech and swallow evaluation, however on reevaluation \r\nafter receiving tube feeds for some time, she was able to \r\ntolerate a regular diet and thin liquids. Her caloric intake by \r\nmouth was not sufficient to decrease tube feeds.\r\n\r\n# Hx Wernicke's Encephalopathy:\r\nPatient had waxing/waning mental status for much of her early \r\nhospital course which was initially attributed to delirium; \r\nhowever, for history of Wernicke's she was started on high-dose \r\nthiamine that seemed to improve her mental status. Nutrition was \r\nconsulted, and nutrition labs were sent that were all markedly \r\nlow. She was supplemented through her TFs and will need to \r\nremain on standing thiamine.\r\n\r\n# Deep Vein Thrombosis:\r\nPatient arrived to MICU with L femoral CVL; shortly thereafter, \r\nasymmetric R > L lower extremity swelling was noticed for which \r\n___ was obtained - this showed extensive venous clot burden in \r\nthe R lower extremity. IV heparin was started. Because of \r\npersistent thrombocytopenia, an IVC filter was placed, though \r\nbecause of her high clot risk IV heparin was continued. She \r\nshould have interval follow-up of her DVTs after discharge, as \r\nwell as scheduled follow-up with ___ for filter removal. She was \r\nmaintained on a heparin drip and should be bridged to Coumadin \r\nto follow up with hematology/oncology as an outpatient.\r\n \r\n# Concern for Gastrointestinal Bleed:\r\nAs described above, GI and Surgery were consulted early in her \r\nMICU stay for rising lactate and concern of gut ischemia in the \r\nsetting of her hypotension; flexible sigmoidoscopy was \r\nunimpressive and lactate improved with pressors and IVF. Near \r\nthe end of her FICU stay she had fresh blood coating a stool \r\nwhich raised concern for GIB; however, her Hct was stable, she \r\nwas HD stable, and guaiacs of subsequent stools were negative \r\nprior to MICU discharge. She underwent evaluation by Hepatology \r\nand EGD which showed no varices, negative colonoscopy. Capsule \r\nstudy failed, but patient's H/H stabilized and hepatology felt \r\nthe study could be done as an outpatient if necessary.\r\n\r\n**Transitional:**\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n-Patient will need daily assessment for hemodialysis needs, EPO \r\nwith HD given renal failure\r\n-Reassess nutritional status and continued need for tube \r\nfeeding, potential need for G-tube\r\n-Daily electrolytes and every other day CBC to evaluate need for \r\nblood transfusion\r\n-Patient on heparin gtt for DVT.

The mediastinal and hilar contours are \r\nnormal. The \r\npulmonary vasculature is normal. Lungs are clear.  No pleural \r\neffusion or \r\npneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  \r\nChain sutures are noted in the left upper quadrant of the \r\nabdomen. \r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\nNo acute cardiopulmonary abnormality \r\n\r\n___ CT abd/pelvis:\r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\n1. No active extravasation of contrast to suggest active GI \r\nbleeding at this time. \r\n2. Profound hepatic steatosis.  Enlarged periportal lymph nodes \r\nwith hazy \r\nmesentery and retroperitoneum likely reflect underlying liver \r\ndisease. \r\n3.  Colonic and rectal wall thickening which may reflect colitis \r\nversus portal colopathy.\r\n4. Heterogeneous appearance of the kidneys with possible \r\nstriated nephrograms. Correlate with urinalysis to exclude \r\npyelonephritis. \r\n\r\n___ TTE:\r\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are \r\nnormal (LVEF = 65%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal \r\nleft ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right \r\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The \r\ndiameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are \r\nnormal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal \r\nwith good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic \r\nregurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. \r\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly myxomatous. Frank mitral \r\nvalve prolapse is not seen but cannot be excluded with \r\ncertainty. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate \r\n(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature \r\nof the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly \r\nunderestimated (Coanda effect). There is borderline pulmonary \r\nartery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.  \r\n\r\n\r\n___ ___\r\nIMPRESSION:   \r\n1. Occlusive thrombus of all right lower extremity deep veins \r\nfrom the common femoral vein down to the calf veins. \r\n2. Patent left lower extremity veins. \r\n\r\n___ ECHO\r\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is \r\nnormal. LV systolic function appears depressed (LVEF = 40%) \r\nsecondary to hypokinesis of the basal two-thirds of the left \r\nventricle. The apical one-third of the left ventricle is \r\nhyperdynamic. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall \r\nmotion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, \r\nascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets \r\n(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No \r\naortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are \r\nmildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic \r\npressure is normal. The pulmonary artery is not well visualized. \r\nThere is no pericardial effusion. \r\n Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \r\nleft ventricular systolic dysfunction is now present. Findings \r\nsuggestive of stress cardiomyopathy with inverse Takotsubo \r\npattern of left ventricular contractile dysfunction.  \r\n\r\n___ CTH:\r\nIMPRESSION: \r\n1. There is mild progression of global cerebral atrophy since \r\nthe prior \r\nexamination of ___, greater than would be expected \r\nfor the \r\npatient's age. \r\n2. No intracranial hemorrhage or territorial infarct. \r\n\r\n___ LIVER US:\r\nIMPRESSION:    \r\n1.  Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of \r\nliver disease including steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, or \r\ncirrhosis cannot be excluded on the basis of this examination. \r\n2.  Trace ascites and small right pleural effusion. \r\n\r\n___ IVC filter placement:\r\nFINDINGS:   \r\n1. Patent normal sized, non-duplicated IVC with  no evidence of \r\na IVC \r\nthrombus. A small circumaortic renal vein originating from the \r\nIVC just above the bifurcation was noted however is very small \r\nin caliber and likely of no clinical significance. \r\n2. Successful deployment of an infra-renal retrievable IVC \r\nfilter. \r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\nSuccessful deployment of an infra-renal removable IVC filter. \r\n\r\n___ ECHO:\r\nConclusions   \r\n The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left \r\nventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular \r\nsystolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). Right ventricular \r\nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve \r\nleaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet \r\nexcursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The \r\nmitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral \r\nregurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary \r\nartery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a \r\ntrivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. \r\n IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved \r\nregional and low normal global biventricular systolic function. \r\nNo valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified. Trivial \r\npericardial effusion. \r\n\r\n___ Unilateral RLE veins \r\nIMPRESSION:    \r\nExtensive deep venous thrombosis involving the wall of the right \r\nlower \r\nextremity veins, overall similar to ___, but now with \r\nperhaps minimal flow in the distal right SFV. \r\n\r\n___ Video oropharyngeal swallow study\r\nAspiration with thin liquid consistency.\r\n\r\n___ Portable abdomen x-ray\r\nPatient is post gastric bypass surgery.  The Dobbhoff tube ends \r\nin the \r\nproximal jejunum. \r\n\r\n___ Renal ultrasound\r\nNo evidence of hydronephrosis.  Increased renal echogenicity \r\nconsistent with diffuse parenchymal renal disease.   \r\nSmall bilateral effusions and small to moderate volume ascites. \r\n\r\n___ - EGD\r\nDuodenum was not examined. Small gastric pouch consistent with \r\nRoux en y anatomy the blind limb and jejunal limb were both \r\nvisualized. No varices. Otherwise normal EGD to the jejunum.\r\n\r\n \r\nBrief Hospital Course:\r\n___ hx gastric bypass surgery, alcohol abuse complicated by \r\nWernicke's encephalopathy, concern for autonomic insufficiency, \r\npresented originally with hypotension, anemia and academia. Her \r\ncourse in the MICU was complicated by severe nutritional \r\ndeficiency, volume overload, renal failure, cardiomyopathy, \r\nhypoxemia and hypoxemic respiratory failure, and deep vein \r\nthrombosis.\r\n\r\n# Hypotension:\r\n# Cardiomyopathy: \r\n# Presumed alcoholic liver disease:\r\nPatient was given 4u PRBCs in the ED prior to FICU admission; \r\nher Hgb was stable for days afterward, and there was low \r\nsuspicion for active GIB initially in her MICU course. She was \r\nempirically antiobiosed for concern of sepsis, but no source was \r\nfound, and these antibiotics were held until a series of \r\npresumed aspiration events that will be discussed below. Morning \r\ncortisol was within normal limits twice; TSH was also within \r\nnormal limits. She underwent several echocardiograms to explain \r\nher persistent hypotension with pressor requirement that showed \r\nin sequence: mitral regurgitation with eccentric jet; inverse \r\nTakutsubo's cardiomyopathy; and then resolution of these issues. \r\nOf note, the resolution occurred after initiation of high-dose \r\nthiamine repletion, which may suggest an element of wet \r\nberiberbi from severe nutritional deficiency in the setting of \r\ngastric bypass and alcoholism. There was also strong suspicion \r\nof cirrhosis given her imaging and alcohol abuse history, for \r\nwhich she was started on midodrine. With these measures, she was \r\nsuccessfully weaned from pressors. Unresolved at the time of her \r\nMICU discharge was a question of autonomic insufficiency raised \r\nin her last Discharge Summary of ___ where it was thought her \r\nalcohol abuse could be contributing to baseline systolic \r\npressures in the ___. This in part resolved on the floor as the \r\npatient was weaned off midodrine and maintained systolic blood \r\npressure in the 100s.\r\n\r\n# Anemia: \r\n-Unexplained, possible GI source with lack of erythropoietin in \r\nthe setting of subacute renal failure . Patient had decreasing \r\npRBC transfusion requirements over the course of her stay, \r\nultimately needing 1U pRBC every 4 days. She was evaluated by \r\nHem/Onc who felt there was no evidence of significant hemolysis \r\nor malignancy and felt that there was an element of anemia of \r\nchronic inflammation, as well as decreased erythropoietin in the \r\nsetting of subacute renal failure. She was evaluated by GI who \r\nfound no source of bleed on sigmoidoscopy early in her course \r\nand no varices or bleeding on EGD. She had an episode of guaiac \r\npositive stool but had no significant bleeding on colonoscopy. \r\nPatient may benefit from outpatient capsule study if bleeding is \r\nongoing.\r\n\r\n# Thrombocytopenia: \r\nThere was no evidence of active bleed on presentation (stool \r\nnormal color, not tachycardic, no clinical or radiographic \r\nevidence of extravasation into a compartment). Surgery and GI \r\nwere consulted early in her MICU course for concern of ischemic \r\ngut in the setting of rising lactate, but flexible sigmoidoscopy \r\nwas negative for this and lactate resolved with fluid \r\nresuscitation. ___ Hematology consulted, and believe her \r\nanemia and thrombocytopenia are likely a combination of \r\nalcoholic bone marrow suppression, malnutrition and critical \r\nillness. She may benefit from a bone marrow biopsy when more \r\nstable; additionally, given her renal failure, she may have a \r\ndeveloping EPO deficiency. She was transfused by ED prior to \r\nMICU admission and did not require further blood products until \r\n___ (gradually dropping Hct attributed to anemia of chronic \r\nillness/inflammation/underproduction; she held her Hct each time \r\nafter transfusion).  \r\n\r\n# Diarrhea:\r\nNegative c. diff, improved over the course of the hospital stay. \r\nPossibly related to tube feeding formulas as this improved with \r\nchanging to a higher fiber formula and with the addition of \r\nbanana flakes. Recommend continued loperamide as needed and \r\noptimization of tube feeds in patient s/p gastric bypass.\r\n\r\n# Renal Failure (Addressed Separately Below):\r\nPresented with serum bicarbonate of 8 of unclear etiology. She \r\nmanifested diarrhea in the early part of her ICU stay (C diff \r\nassay negative, thought related to either alcohol abuse or early \r\ncourse of antibiotics administered empirically for presumed \r\nsepsis, resolved); her renal function markers may also have been \r\nunder-estimates of her true GFR given her nutritionally \r\ndeficient state. Acidemia corrected with bicarbonate drip, but \r\nrecurrence remains in a concern in the setting of her renal \r\nfailure with poor UOP. CRRT was started in the setting of volume \r\noverload in the ICU as described above, though she was noted to \r\nhave ATN by muddy brown casts in her urine as well as \r\npersistently poor UOP. At time of FICU discharge she is being \r\ntrialed off CRRT, though with her poor UOP she may need to be \r\ninitiated on standing dialysis. Upon transfer to the floor, her \r\nrenal function did not improve and she remained oliguric. She \r\nwas evaluated by nephrology who felt that ATN without renal \r\nrecovery was the most likely diagnosis based on her urine \r\nsediment and history. A renal biopsy was considered, but \r\nnephrology felt that the risks of the biopsy on a patient \r\nalready requiring heparin for DVT would outweigh the benefits \r\nwith the suspicion of ATN being high already. Urine output \r\nremained low prior to discharge, and tunneled HD line was placed \r\nfor longer-term access.\r\n\r\n# Respiratory Failure:\r\nPatient developed progressive hypoxemia from volume overload \r\neventually requiring CRRT with resolution of the same. However, \r\non ___ she had an unexplained hypoxemic respiratory episode \r\nwith persistent SpO2 measurements in the ___ despite NRB and NC; \r\nshe was intubated with ___ of continued O2 saturations in \r\nthe ___ before resolution not attributable to any particular \r\nintervention (nebs, suction, etc). This first hypoxemic episode \r\nwas attributed to aspiration though subsequent CXR and \r\nbronchoscopy were not impressive for evidence of the same. She \r\nwas extubated within 24hrs, but then reintubated in the setting \r\nof a break in her CRRT line that caused acute hypotension from \r\nblood loss (trapped in the CRRT circuit) and then hypoxemia. \r\nAfter restoration of hemodynamic stability and passing her RSBI, \r\nshe was again extubated, but re-intubated for nearly the same \r\nexact sequence of events that evening(break in the CRRT circuit \r\ndue to equipment failure; this has been reported and is being \r\ninvestigated). She was finally extubated on ___ and remains \r\noff supplemental O2 at time of MICU discharge. Antibiotics were \r\nempirically started in the setting of possible aspiration with \r\nleukocytosis (that could have been a stress reaction to \r\naspiration pneumonitis or intubations/exbuations); these will \r\nfinish on ___. She completed her course of antibiotics and \r\nremained afebrile and without respiratory distress the rest of \r\nher hospitalization. \r\n\r\n# Alcohol Abuse:\r\nPatient endorses heavy alcohol use. She was seen by social work \r\nwho gave resources, though patient is not interested in \r\ncounseling.\r\n\r\n# Severe Nutritional Deficiency:\r\nNutritional deficiencies including zinc and selenium requiring \r\nsignificant repletion. Repeat testing of zinc showed continued \r\nneed for repletion. Caloric needs and repletion addressed below.\r\n\r\n# Severe malnutrition: likely contributor to pancytopenia \r\nresulting from bone marrow suppression. Required tube feeding \r\ntube feed which was continued at discharge in order to meet her \r\ncaloric needs. She was initially found to aspirate thin liquids \r\nby a speech and swallow evaluation, however on reevaluation \r\nafter receiving tube feeds for some time, she was able to \r\ntolerate a regular diet and thin liquids. Her caloric intake by \r\nmouth was not sufficient to decrease tube feeds.\r\n\r\n# Hx Wernicke's Encephalopathy:\r\nPatient had waxing/waning mental status for much of her early \r\nhospital course which was initially attributed to delirium; \r\nhowever, for history of Wernicke's she was started on high-dose \r\nthiamine that seemed to improve her mental status. Nutrition was \r\nconsulted, and nutrition labs were sent that were all markedly \r\nlow. She was supplemented through her TFs and will need to \r\nremain on standing thiamine.\r\n\r\n# Deep Vein Thrombosis:\r\nPatient arrived to MICU with L femoral CVL; shortly thereafter, \r\nasymmetric R > L lower extremity swelling was noticed for which \r\n___ was obtained - this showed extensive venous clot burden in \r\nthe R lower extremity. IV heparin was started. Because of \r\npersistent thrombocytopenia, an IVC filter was placed, though \r\nbecause of her high clot risk IV heparin was continued. She \r\nshould have interval follow-up of her DVTs after discharge, as \r\nwell as scheduled follow-up with ___ for filter removal. She was \r\nmaintained on a heparin drip and should be bridged to Coumadin \r\nto follow up with hematology/oncology as an outpatient.\r\n \r\n# Concern for Gastrointestinal Bleed:\r\nAs described above, GI and Surgery were consulted early in her \r\nMICU stay for rising lactate and concern of gut ischemia in the \r\nsetting of her hypotension; flexible sigmoidoscopy was \r\nunimpressive and lactate improved with pressors and IVF. Near \r\nthe end of her FICU stay she had fresh blood coating a stool \r\nwhich raised concern for GIB; however, her Hct was stable, she \r\nwas HD stable, and guaiacs of subsequent stools were negative \r\nprior to MICU discharge. She underwent evaluation by Hepatology \r\nand EGD which showed no varices, negative colonoscopy. Capsule \r\nstudy failed, but patient's H/H stabilized and hepatology felt \r\nthe study could be done as an outpatient if necessary.\r\n\r\n**Transitional:**\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n-Patient will need daily assessment for hemodialysis needs, EPO \r\nwith HD given renal failure\r\n-Reassess nutritional status and continued need for tube \r\nfeeding, potential need for G-tube\r\n-Daily electrolytes and every other day CBC to evaluate need for \r\nblood transfusion\r\n-Patient on heparin gtt for DVT.

An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate \n(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature \nof the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly \nunderestimated (Coanda effect). There is borderline pulmonary \nartery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. ___ ___",

The mediastinal and hilar contours are \r\nnormal. The \r\npulmonary vasculature is normal. Lungs are clear.  No pleural \r\neffusion or \r\npneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  \r\nChain sutures are noted in the left upper quadrant of the \r\nabdomen. \r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\nNo acute cardiopulmonary abnormality \r\n\r\n___ CT abd/pelvis:\r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\n1. No active extravasation of contrast to suggest active GI \r\nbleeding at this time. \r\n2. Profound hepatic steatosis.  Enlarged periportal lymph nodes \r\nwith hazy \r\nmesentery and retroperitoneum likely reflect underlying liver \r\ndisease. \r\n3.  Colonic and rectal wall thickening which may reflect colitis \r\nversus portal colopathy.\r\n4. Heterogeneous appearance of the kidneys with possible \r\nstriated nephrograms. Correlate with urinalysis to exclude \r\npyelonephritis. \r\n\r\n___ TTE:\r\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are \r\nnormal (LVEF = 65%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal \r\nleft ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right \r\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The \r\ndiameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are \r\nnormal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal \r\nwith good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic \r\nregurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. \r\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly myxomatous. Frank mitral \r\nvalve prolapse is not seen but cannot be excluded with \r\ncertainty. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate \r\n(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature \r\nof the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly \r\nunderestimated (Coanda effect). There is borderline pulmonary \r\nartery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.  \r\n\r\n\r\n___ ___\r\nIMPRESSION:   \r\n1. Occlusive thrombus of all right lower extremity deep veins \r\nfrom the common femoral vein down to the calf veins. \r\n2. Patent left lower extremity veins. \r\n\r\n___ ECHO\r\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is \r\nnormal. LV systolic function appears depressed (LVEF = 40%) \r\nsecondary to hypokinesis of the basal two-thirds of the left \r\nventricle. The apical one-third of the left ventricle is \r\nhyperdynamic. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall \r\nmotion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, \r\nascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets \r\n(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No \r\naortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are \r\nmildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic \r\npressure is normal. The pulmonary artery is not well visualized. \r\nThere is no pericardial effusion. \r\n Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \r\nleft ventricular systolic dysfunction is now present. Findings \r\nsuggestive of stress cardiomyopathy with inverse Takotsubo \r\npattern of left ventricular contractile dysfunction.  \r\n\r\n___ CTH:\r\nIMPRESSION: \r\n1. There is mild progression of global cerebral atrophy since \r\nthe prior \r\nexamination of ___, greater than would be expected \r\nfor the \r\npatient's age. \r\n2. No intracranial hemorrhage or territorial infarct. \r\n\r\n___ LIVER US:\r\nIMPRESSION:    \r\n1.  Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of \r\nliver disease including steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, or \r\ncirrhosis cannot be excluded on the basis of this examination. \r\n2.  Trace ascites and small right pleural effusion. \r\n\r\n___ IVC filter placement:\r\nFINDINGS:   \r\n1. Patent normal sized, non-duplicated IVC with  no evidence of \r\na IVC \r\nthrombus. A small circumaortic renal vein originating from the \r\nIVC just above the bifurcation was noted however is very small \r\nin caliber and likely of no clinical significance. \r\n2. Successful deployment of an infra-renal retrievable IVC \r\nfilter. \r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\nSuccessful deployment of an infra-renal removable IVC filter. \r\n\r\n___ ECHO:\r\nConclusions   \r\n The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left \r\nventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular \r\nsystolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). Right ventricular \r\nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve \r\nleaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet \r\nexcursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The \r\nmitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral \r\nregurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary \r\nartery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a \r\ntrivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. \r\n IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved \r\nregional and low normal global biventricular systolic function. \r\nNo valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified. Trivial \r\npericardial effusion. \r\n\r\n___ Unilateral RLE veins \r\nIMPRESSION:    \r\nExtensive deep venous thrombosis involving the wall of the right \r\nlower \r\nextremity veins, overall similar to ___, but now with \r\nperhaps minimal flow in the distal right SFV. \r\n\r\n___ Video oropharyngeal swallow study\r\nAspiration with thin liquid consistency.\r\n\r\n___ Portable abdomen x-ray\r\nPatient is post gastric bypass surgery.  The Dobbhoff tube ends \r\nin the \r\nproximal jejunum. \r\n\r\n___ Renal ultrasound\r\nNo evidence of hydronephrosis.  Increased renal echogenicity \r\nconsistent with diffuse parenchymal renal disease.   \r\nSmall bilateral effusions and small to moderate volume ascites. \r\n\r\n___ - EGD\r\nDuodenum was not examined. Small gastric pouch consistent with \r\nRoux en y anatomy the blind limb and jejunal limb were both \r\nvisualized. No varices. Otherwise normal EGD to the jejunum.\r\n\r\n \r\nBrief Hospital Course:\r\n___ hx gastric bypass surgery, alcohol abuse complicated by \r\nWernicke's encephalopathy, concern for autonomic insufficiency, \r\npresented originally with hypotension, anemia and academia. Her \r\ncourse in the MICU was complicated by severe nutritional \r\ndeficiency, volume overload, renal failure, cardiomyopathy, \r\nhypoxemia and hypoxemic respiratory failure, and deep vein \r\nthrombosis.\r\n\r\n# Hypotension:\r\n# Cardiomyopathy: \r\n# Presumed alcoholic liver disease:\r\nPatient was given 4u PRBCs in the ED prior to FICU admission; \r\nher Hgb was stable for days afterward, and there was low \r\nsuspicion for active GIB initially in her MICU course. She was \r\nempirically antiobiosed for concern of sepsis, but no source was \r\nfound, and these antibiotics were held until a series of \r\npresumed aspiration events that will be discussed below. Morning \r\ncortisol was within normal limits twice; TSH was also within \r\nnormal limits. She underwent several echocardiograms to explain \r\nher persistent hypotension with pressor requirement that showed \r\nin sequence: mitral regurgitation with eccentric jet; inverse \r\nTakutsubo's cardiomyopathy; and then resolution of these issues. \r\nOf note, the resolution occurred after initiation of high-dose \r\nthiamine repletion, which may suggest an element of wet \r\nberiberbi from severe nutritional deficiency in the setting of \r\ngastric bypass and alcoholism. There was also strong suspicion \r\nof cirrhosis given her imaging and alcohol abuse history, for \r\nwhich she was started on midodrine. With these measures, she was \r\nsuccessfully weaned from pressors. Unresolved at the time of her \r\nMICU discharge was a question of autonomic insufficiency raised \r\nin her last Discharge Summary of ___ where it was thought her \r\nalcohol abuse could be contributing to baseline systolic \r\npressures in the ___. This in part resolved on the floor as the \r\npatient was weaned off midodrine and maintained systolic blood \r\npressure in the 100s.\r\n\r\n# Anemia: \r\n-Unexplained, possible GI source with lack of erythropoietin in \r\nthe setting of subacute renal failure . Patient had decreasing \r\npRBC transfusion requirements over the course of her stay, \r\nultimately needing 1U pRBC every 4 days. She was evaluated by \r\nHem/Onc who felt there was no evidence of significant hemolysis \r\nor malignancy and felt that there was an element of anemia of \r\nchronic inflammation, as well as decreased erythropoietin in the \r\nsetting of subacute renal failure. She was evaluated by GI who \r\nfound no source of bleed on sigmoidoscopy early in her course \r\nand no varices or bleeding on EGD. She had an episode of guaiac \r\npositive stool but had no significant bleeding on colonoscopy. \r\nPatient may benefit from outpatient capsule study if bleeding is \r\nongoing.\r\n\r\n# Thrombocytopenia: \r\nThere was no evidence of active bleed on presentation (stool \r\nnormal color, not tachycardic, no clinical or radiographic \r\nevidence of extravasation into a compartment). Surgery and GI \r\nwere consulted early in her MICU course for concern of ischemic \r\ngut in the setting of rising lactate, but flexible sigmoidoscopy \r\nwas negative for this and lactate resolved with fluid \r\nresuscitation. ___ Hematology consulted, and believe her \r\nanemia and thrombocytopenia are likely a combination of \r\nalcoholic bone marrow suppression, malnutrition and critical \r\nillness. She may benefit from a bone marrow biopsy when more \r\nstable; additionally, given her renal failure, she may have a \r\ndeveloping EPO deficiency. She was transfused by ED prior to \r\nMICU admission and did not require further blood products until \r\n___ (gradually dropping Hct attributed to anemia of chronic \r\nillness/inflammation/underproduction; she held her Hct each time \r\nafter transfusion).  \r\n\r\n# Diarrhea:\r\nNegative c. diff, improved over the course of the hospital stay. \r\nPossibly related to tube feeding formulas as this improved with \r\nchanging to a higher fiber formula and with the addition of \r\nbanana flakes. Recommend continued loperamide as needed and \r\noptimization of tube feeds in patient s/p gastric bypass.\r\n\r\n# Renal Failure (Addressed Separately Below):\r\nPresented with serum bicarbonate of 8 of unclear etiology. She \r\nmanifested diarrhea in the early part of her ICU stay (C diff \r\nassay negative, thought related to either alcohol abuse or early \r\ncourse of antibiotics administered empirically for presumed \r\nsepsis, resolved); her renal function markers may also have been \r\nunder-estimates of her true GFR given her nutritionally \r\ndeficient state. Acidemia corrected with bicarbonate drip, but \r\nrecurrence remains in a concern in the setting of her renal \r\nfailure with poor UOP. CRRT was started in the setting of volume \r\noverload in the ICU as described above, though she was noted to \r\nhave ATN by muddy brown casts in her urine as well as \r\npersistently poor UOP. At time of FICU discharge she is being \r\ntrialed off CRRT, though with her poor UOP she may need to be \r\ninitiated on standing dialysis. Upon transfer to the floor, her \r\nrenal function did not improve and she remained oliguric. She \r\nwas evaluated by nephrology who felt that ATN without renal \r\nrecovery was the most likely diagnosis based on her urine \r\nsediment and history. A renal biopsy was considered, but \r\nnephrology felt that the risks of the biopsy on a patient \r\nalready requiring heparin for DVT would outweigh the benefits \r\nwith the suspicion of ATN being high already. Urine output \r\nremained low prior to discharge, and tunneled HD line was placed \r\nfor longer-term access.\r\n\r\n# Respiratory Failure:\r\nPatient developed progressive hypoxemia from volume overload \r\neventually requiring CRRT with resolution of the same. However, \r\non ___ she had an unexplained hypoxemic respiratory episode \r\nwith persistent SpO2 measurements in the ___ despite NRB and NC; \r\nshe was intubated with ___ of continued O2 saturations in \r\nthe ___ before resolution not attributable to any particular \r\nintervention (nebs, suction, etc). This first hypoxemic episode \r\nwas attributed to aspiration though subsequent CXR and \r\nbronchoscopy were not impressive for evidence of the same. She \r\nwas extubated within 24hrs, but then reintubated in the setting \r\nof a break in her CRRT line that caused acute hypotension from \r\nblood loss (trapped in the CRRT circuit) and then hypoxemia. \r\nAfter restoration of hemodynamic stability and passing her RSBI, \r\nshe was again extubated, but re-intubated for nearly the same \r\nexact sequence of events that evening(break in the CRRT circuit \r\ndue to equipment failure; this has been reported and is being \r\ninvestigated). She was finally extubated on ___ and remains \r\noff supplemental O2 at time of MICU discharge. Antibiotics were \r\nempirically started in the setting of possible aspiration with \r\nleukocytosis (that could have been a stress reaction to \r\naspiration pneumonitis or intubations/exbuations); these will \r\nfinish on ___. She completed her course of antibiotics and \r\nremained afebrile and without respiratory distress the rest of \r\nher hospitalization. \r\n\r\n# Alcohol Abuse:\r\nPatient endorses heavy alcohol use. She was seen by social work \r\nwho gave resources, though patient is not interested in \r\ncounseling.\r\n\r\n# Severe Nutritional Deficiency:\r\nNutritional deficiencies including zinc and selenium requiring \r\nsignificant repletion. Repeat testing of zinc showed continued \r\nneed for repletion. Caloric needs and repletion addressed below.\r\n\r\n# Severe malnutrition: likely contributor to pancytopenia \r\nresulting from bone marrow suppression. Required tube feeding \r\ntube feed which was continued at discharge in order to meet her \r\ncaloric needs. She was initially found to aspirate thin liquids \r\nby a speech and swallow evaluation, however on reevaluation \r\nafter receiving tube feeds for some time, she was able to \r\ntolerate a regular diet and thin liquids. Her caloric intake by \r\nmouth was not sufficient to decrease tube feeds.\r\n\r\n# Hx Wernicke's Encephalopathy:\r\nPatient had waxing/waning mental status for much of her early \r\nhospital course which was initially attributed to delirium; \r\nhowever, for history of Wernicke's she was started on high-dose \r\nthiamine that seemed to improve her mental status. Nutrition was \r\nconsulted, and nutrition labs were sent that were all markedly \r\nlow. She was supplemented through her TFs and will need to \r\nremain on standing thiamine.\r\n\r\n# Deep Vein Thrombosis:\r\nPatient arrived to MICU with L femoral CVL; shortly thereafter, \r\nasymmetric R > L lower extremity swelling was noticed for which \r\n___ was obtained - this showed extensive venous clot burden in \r\nthe R lower extremity. IV heparin was started. Because of \r\npersistent thrombocytopenia, an IVC filter was placed, though \r\nbecause of her high clot risk IV heparin was continued. She \r\nshould have interval follow-up of her DVTs after discharge, as \r\nwell as scheduled follow-up with ___ for filter removal. She was \r\nmaintained on a heparin drip and should be bridged to Coumadin \r\nto follow up with hematology/oncology as an outpatient.\r\n \r\n# Concern for Gastrointestinal Bleed:\r\nAs described above, GI and Surgery were consulted early in her \r\nMICU stay for rising lactate and concern of gut ischemia in the \r\nsetting of her hypotension; flexible sigmoidoscopy was \r\nunimpressive and lactate improved with pressors and IVF. Near \r\nthe end of her FICU stay she had fresh blood coating a stool \r\nwhich raised concern for GIB; however, her Hct was stable, she \r\nwas HD stable, and guaiacs of subsequent stools were negative \r\nprior to MICU discharge. She underwent evaluation by Hepatology \r\nand EGD which showed no varices, negative colonoscopy. Capsule \r\nstudy failed, but patient's H/H stabilized and hepatology felt \r\nthe study could be done as an outpatient if necessary.\r\n\r\n**Transitional:**\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n-Patient will need daily assessment for hemodialysis needs, EPO \r\nwith HD given renal failure\r\n-Reassess nutritional status and continued need for tube \r\nfeeding, potential need for G-tube\r\n-Daily electrolytes and every other day CBC to evaluate need for \r\nblood transfusion\r\n-Patient on heparin gtt for DVT.

There is mild progression of global cerebral atrophy since \nthe prior \nexamination of ___, greater than would be expected \nfor the \npatient's age. 2. No intracranial hemorrhage or territorial infarct. ___ LIVER US: IMPRESSION:    \n1. Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of \nliver disease including steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, or \ncirrhosis cannot be excluded on the basis of this examination. 2. Trace ascites and small right pleural effusion. ___ IVC filter placement: FINDINGS:   \n1. Patent normal sized, non-duplicated IVC with  no evidence of \na IVC \nthrombus. A small circumaortic renal vein originating from the \nIVC just above the bifurcation was noted however is very small \nin caliber and likely of no clinical significance. 2.

The mediastinal and hilar contours are \r\nnormal. The \r\npulmonary vasculature is normal. Lungs are clear.  No pleural \r\neffusion or \r\npneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  \r\nChain sutures are noted in the left upper quadrant of the \r\nabdomen. \r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\nNo acute cardiopulmonary abnormality \r\n\r\n___ CT abd/pelvis:\r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\n1. No active extravasation of contrast to suggest active GI \r\nbleeding at this time. \r\n2. Profound hepatic steatosis.  Enlarged periportal lymph nodes \r\nwith hazy \r\nmesentery and retroperitoneum likely reflect underlying liver \r\ndisease. \r\n3.  Colonic and rectal wall thickening which may reflect colitis \r\nversus portal colopathy.\r\n4. Heterogeneous appearance of the kidneys with possible \r\nstriated nephrograms. Correlate with urinalysis to exclude \r\npyelonephritis. \r\n\r\n___ TTE:\r\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are \r\nnormal (LVEF = 65%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal \r\nleft ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right \r\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The \r\ndiameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are \r\nnormal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal \r\nwith good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic \r\nregurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. \r\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly myxomatous. Frank mitral \r\nvalve prolapse is not seen but cannot be excluded with \r\ncertainty. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate \r\n(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature \r\nof the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly \r\nunderestimated (Coanda effect). There is borderline pulmonary \r\nartery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.  \r\n\r\n\r\n___ ___\r\nIMPRESSION:   \r\n1. Occlusive thrombus of all right lower extremity deep veins \r\nfrom the common femoral vein down to the calf veins. \r\n2. Patent left lower extremity veins. \r\n\r\n___ ECHO\r\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is \r\nnormal. LV systolic function appears depressed (LVEF = 40%) \r\nsecondary to hypokinesis of the basal two-thirds of the left \r\nventricle. The apical one-third of the left ventricle is \r\nhyperdynamic. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall \r\nmotion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, \r\nascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets \r\n(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No \r\naortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are \r\nmildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic \r\npressure is normal. The pulmonary artery is not well visualized. \r\nThere is no pericardial effusion. \r\n Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \r\nleft ventricular systolic dysfunction is now present. Findings \r\nsuggestive of stress cardiomyopathy with inverse Takotsubo \r\npattern of left ventricular contractile dysfunction.  \r\n\r\n___ CTH:\r\nIMPRESSION: \r\n1. There is mild progression of global cerebral atrophy since \r\nthe prior \r\nexamination of ___, greater than would be expected \r\nfor the \r\npatient's age. \r\n2. No intracranial hemorrhage or territorial infarct. \r\n\r\n___ LIVER US:\r\nIMPRESSION:    \r\n1.  Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of \r\nliver disease including steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, or \r\ncirrhosis cannot be excluded on the basis of this examination. \r\n2.  Trace ascites and small right pleural effusion. \r\n\r\n___ IVC filter placement:\r\nFINDINGS:   \r\n1. Patent normal sized, non-duplicated IVC with  no evidence of \r\na IVC \r\nthrombus. A small circumaortic renal vein originating from the \r\nIVC just above the bifurcation was noted however is very small \r\nin caliber and likely of no clinical significance. \r\n2. Successful deployment of an infra-renal retrievable IVC \r\nfilter. \r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\nSuccessful deployment of an infra-renal removable IVC filter. \r\n\r\n___ ECHO:\r\nConclusions   \r\n The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left \r\nventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular \r\nsystolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). Right ventricular \r\nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve \r\nleaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet \r\nexcursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The \r\nmitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral \r\nregurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary \r\nartery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a \r\ntrivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. \r\n IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved \r\nregional and low normal global biventricular systolic function. \r\nNo valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified. Trivial \r\npericardial effusion. \r\n\r\n___ Unilateral RLE veins \r\nIMPRESSION:    \r\nExtensive deep venous thrombosis involving the wall of the right \r\nlower \r\nextremity veins, overall similar to ___, but now with \r\nperhaps minimal flow in the distal right SFV. \r\n\r\n___ Video oropharyngeal swallow study\r\nAspiration with thin liquid consistency.\r\n\r\n___ Portable abdomen x-ray\r\nPatient is post gastric bypass surgery.  The Dobbhoff tube ends \r\nin the \r\nproximal jejunum. \r\n\r\n___ Renal ultrasound\r\nNo evidence of hydronephrosis.  Increased renal echogenicity \r\nconsistent with diffuse parenchymal renal disease.   \r\nSmall bilateral effusions and small to moderate volume ascites. \r\n\r\n___ - EGD\r\nDuodenum was not examined. Small gastric pouch consistent with \r\nRoux en y anatomy the blind limb and jejunal limb were both \r\nvisualized. No varices. Otherwise normal EGD to the jejunum.\r\n\r\n \r\nBrief Hospital Course:\r\n___ hx gastric bypass surgery, alcohol abuse complicated by \r\nWernicke's encephalopathy, concern for autonomic insufficiency, \r\npresented originally with hypotension, anemia and academia. Her \r\ncourse in the MICU was complicated by severe nutritional \r\ndeficiency, volume overload, renal failure, cardiomyopathy, \r\nhypoxemia and hypoxemic respiratory failure, and deep vein \r\nthrombosis.\r\n\r\n# Hypotension:\r\n# Cardiomyopathy: \r\n# Presumed alcoholic liver disease:\r\nPatient was given 4u PRBCs in the ED prior to FICU admission; \r\nher Hgb was stable for days afterward, and there was low \r\nsuspicion for active GIB initially in her MICU course. She was \r\nempirically antiobiosed for concern of sepsis, but no source was \r\nfound, and these antibiotics were held until a series of \r\npresumed aspiration events that will be discussed below. Morning \r\ncortisol was within normal limits twice; TSH was also within \r\nnormal limits. She underwent several echocardiograms to explain \r\nher persistent hypotension with pressor requirement that showed \r\nin sequence: mitral regurgitation with eccentric jet; inverse \r\nTakutsubo's cardiomyopathy; and then resolution of these issues. \r\nOf note, the resolution occurred after initiation of high-dose \r\nthiamine repletion, which may suggest an element of wet \r\nberiberbi from severe nutritional deficiency in the setting of \r\ngastric bypass and alcoholism. There was also strong suspicion \r\nof cirrhosis given her imaging and alcohol abuse history, for \r\nwhich she was started on midodrine. With these measures, she was \r\nsuccessfully weaned from pressors. Unresolved at the time of her \r\nMICU discharge was a question of autonomic insufficiency raised \r\nin her last Discharge Summary of ___ where it was thought her \r\nalcohol abuse could be contributing to baseline systolic \r\npressures in the ___. This in part resolved on the floor as the \r\npatient was weaned off midodrine and maintained systolic blood \r\npressure in the 100s.\r\n\r\n# Anemia: \r\n-Unexplained, possible GI source with lack of erythropoietin in \r\nthe setting of subacute renal failure . Patient had decreasing \r\npRBC transfusion requirements over the course of her stay, \r\nultimately needing 1U pRBC every 4 days. She was evaluated by \r\nHem/Onc who felt there was no evidence of significant hemolysis \r\nor malignancy and felt that there was an element of anemia of \r\nchronic inflammation, as well as decreased erythropoietin in the \r\nsetting of subacute renal failure. She was evaluated by GI who \r\nfound no source of bleed on sigmoidoscopy early in her course \r\nand no varices or bleeding on EGD. She had an episode of guaiac \r\npositive stool but had no significant bleeding on colonoscopy. \r\nPatient may benefit from outpatient capsule study if bleeding is \r\nongoing.\r\n\r\n# Thrombocytopenia: \r\nThere was no evidence of active bleed on presentation (stool \r\nnormal color, not tachycardic, no clinical or radiographic \r\nevidence of extravasation into a compartment). Surgery and GI \r\nwere consulted early in her MICU course for concern of ischemic \r\ngut in the setting of rising lactate, but flexible sigmoidoscopy \r\nwas negative for this and lactate resolved with fluid \r\nresuscitation. ___ Hematology consulted, and believe her \r\nanemia and thrombocytopenia are likely a combination of \r\nalcoholic bone marrow suppression, malnutrition and critical \r\nillness. She may benefit from a bone marrow biopsy when more \r\nstable; additionally, given her renal failure, she may have a \r\ndeveloping EPO deficiency. She was transfused by ED prior to \r\nMICU admission and did not require further blood products until \r\n___ (gradually dropping Hct attributed to anemia of chronic \r\nillness/inflammation/underproduction; she held her Hct each time \r\nafter transfusion).  \r\n\r\n# Diarrhea:\r\nNegative c. diff, improved over the course of the hospital stay. \r\nPossibly related to tube feeding formulas as this improved with \r\nchanging to a higher fiber formula and with the addition of \r\nbanana flakes. Recommend continued loperamide as needed and \r\noptimization of tube feeds in patient s/p gastric bypass.\r\n\r\n# Renal Failure (Addressed Separately Below):\r\nPresented with serum bicarbonate of 8 of unclear etiology. She \r\nmanifested diarrhea in the early part of her ICU stay (C diff \r\nassay negative, thought related to either alcohol abuse or early \r\ncourse of antibiotics administered empirically for presumed \r\nsepsis, resolved); her renal function markers may also have been \r\nunder-estimates of her true GFR given her nutritionally \r\ndeficient state. Acidemia corrected with bicarbonate drip, but \r\nrecurrence remains in a concern in the setting of her renal \r\nfailure with poor UOP. CRRT was started in the setting of volume \r\noverload in the ICU as described above, though she was noted to \r\nhave ATN by muddy brown casts in her urine as well as \r\npersistently poor UOP. At time of FICU discharge she is being \r\ntrialed off CRRT, though with her poor UOP she may need to be \r\ninitiated on standing dialysis. Upon transfer to the floor, her \r\nrenal function did not improve and she remained oliguric. She \r\nwas evaluated by nephrology who felt that ATN without renal \r\nrecovery was the most likely diagnosis based on her urine \r\nsediment and history. A renal biopsy was considered, but \r\nnephrology felt that the risks of the biopsy on a patient \r\nalready requiring heparin for DVT would outweigh the benefits \r\nwith the suspicion of ATN being high already. Urine output \r\nremained low prior to discharge, and tunneled HD line was placed \r\nfor longer-term access.\r\n\r\n# Respiratory Failure:\r\nPatient developed progressive hypoxemia from volume overload \r\neventually requiring CRRT with resolution of the same. However, \r\non ___ she had an unexplained hypoxemic respiratory episode \r\nwith persistent SpO2 measurements in the ___ despite NRB and NC; \r\nshe was intubated with ___ of continued O2 saturations in \r\nthe ___ before resolution not attributable to any particular \r\nintervention (nebs, suction, etc). This first hypoxemic episode \r\nwas attributed to aspiration though subsequent CXR and \r\nbronchoscopy were not impressive for evidence of the same. She \r\nwas extubated within 24hrs, but then reintubated in the setting \r\nof a break in her CRRT line that caused acute hypotension from \r\nblood loss (trapped in the CRRT circuit) and then hypoxemia. \r\nAfter restoration of hemodynamic stability and passing her RSBI, \r\nshe was again extubated, but re-intubated for nearly the same \r\nexact sequence of events that evening(break in the CRRT circuit \r\ndue to equipment failure; this has been reported and is being \r\ninvestigated). She was finally extubated on ___ and remains \r\noff supplemental O2 at time of MICU discharge. Antibiotics were \r\nempirically started in the setting of possible aspiration with \r\nleukocytosis (that could have been a stress reaction to \r\naspiration pneumonitis or intubations/exbuations); these will \r\nfinish on ___. She completed her course of antibiotics and \r\nremained afebrile and without respiratory distress the rest of \r\nher hospitalization. \r\n\r\n# Alcohol Abuse:\r\nPatient endorses heavy alcohol use. She was seen by social work \r\nwho gave resources, though patient is not interested in \r\ncounseling.\r\n\r\n# Severe Nutritional Deficiency:\r\nNutritional deficiencies including zinc and selenium requiring \r\nsignificant repletion. Repeat testing of zinc showed continued \r\nneed for repletion. Caloric needs and repletion addressed below.\r\n\r\n# Severe malnutrition: likely contributor to pancytopenia \r\nresulting from bone marrow suppression. Required tube feeding \r\ntube feed which was continued at discharge in order to meet her \r\ncaloric needs. She was initially found to aspirate thin liquids \r\nby a speech and swallow evaluation, however on reevaluation \r\nafter receiving tube feeds for some time, she was able to \r\ntolerate a regular diet and thin liquids. Her caloric intake by \r\nmouth was not sufficient to decrease tube feeds.\r\n\r\n# Hx Wernicke's Encephalopathy:\r\nPatient had waxing/waning mental status for much of her early \r\nhospital course which was initially attributed to delirium; \r\nhowever, for history of Wernicke's she was started on high-dose \r\nthiamine that seemed to improve her mental status. Nutrition was \r\nconsulted, and nutrition labs were sent that were all markedly \r\nlow. She was supplemented through her TFs and will need to \r\nremain on standing thiamine.\r\n\r\n# Deep Vein Thrombosis:\r\nPatient arrived to MICU with L femoral CVL; shortly thereafter, \r\nasymmetric R > L lower extremity swelling was noticed for which \r\n___ was obtained - this showed extensive venous clot burden in \r\nthe R lower extremity. IV heparin was started. Because of \r\npersistent thrombocytopenia, an IVC filter was placed, though \r\nbecause of her high clot risk IV heparin was continued. She \r\nshould have interval follow-up of her DVTs after discharge, as \r\nwell as scheduled follow-up with ___ for filter removal. She was \r\nmaintained on a heparin drip and should be bridged to Coumadin \r\nto follow up with hematology/oncology as an outpatient.\r\n \r\n# Concern for Gastrointestinal Bleed:\r\nAs described above, GI and Surgery were consulted early in her \r\nMICU stay for rising lactate and concern of gut ischemia in the \r\nsetting of her hypotension; flexible sigmoidoscopy was \r\nunimpressive and lactate improved with pressors and IVF. Near \r\nthe end of her FICU stay she had fresh blood coating a stool \r\nwhich raised concern for GIB; however, her Hct was stable, she \r\nwas HD stable, and guaiacs of subsequent stools were negative \r\nprior to MICU discharge. She underwent evaluation by Hepatology \r\nand EGD which showed no varices, negative colonoscopy. Capsule \r\nstudy failed, but patient's H/H stabilized and hepatology felt \r\nthe study could be done as an outpatient if necessary.\r\n\r\n**Transitional:**\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n-Patient will need daily assessment for hemodialysis needs, EPO \r\nwith HD given renal failure\r\n-Reassess nutritional status and continued need for tube \r\nfeeding, potential need for G-tube\r\n-Daily electrolytes and every other day CBC to evaluate need for \r\nblood transfusion\r\n-Patient on heparin gtt for DVT.

The mediastinal and hilar contours are \r\nnormal. The \r\npulmonary vasculature is normal. Lungs are clear.  No pleural \r\neffusion or \r\npneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  \r\nChain sutures are noted in the left upper quadrant of the \r\nabdomen. \r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\nNo acute cardiopulmonary abnormality \r\n\r\n___ CT abd/pelvis:\r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\n1. No active extravasation of contrast to suggest active GI \r\nbleeding at this time. \r\n2. Profound hepatic steatosis.  Enlarged periportal lymph nodes \r\nwith hazy \r\nmesentery and retroperitoneum likely reflect underlying liver \r\ndisease. \r\n3.  Colonic and rectal wall thickening which may reflect colitis \r\nversus portal colopathy.\r\n4. Heterogeneous appearance of the kidneys with possible \r\nstriated nephrograms. Correlate with urinalysis to exclude \r\npyelonephritis. \r\n\r\n___ TTE:\r\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are \r\nnormal (LVEF = 65%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal \r\nleft ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right \r\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The \r\ndiameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are \r\nnormal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal \r\nwith good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic \r\nregurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. \r\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly myxomatous. Frank mitral \r\nvalve prolapse is not seen but cannot be excluded with \r\ncertainty. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate \r\n(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature \r\nof the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly \r\nunderestimated (Coanda effect). There is borderline pulmonary \r\nartery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.  \r\n\r\n\r\n___ ___\r\nIMPRESSION:   \r\n1. Occlusive thrombus of all right lower extremity deep veins \r\nfrom the common femoral vein down to the calf veins. \r\n2. Patent left lower extremity veins. \r\n\r\n___ ECHO\r\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is \r\nnormal. LV systolic function appears depressed (LVEF = 40%) \r\nsecondary to hypokinesis of the basal two-thirds of the left \r\nventricle. The apical one-third of the left ventricle is \r\nhyperdynamic. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall \r\nmotion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, \r\nascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets \r\n(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No \r\naortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are \r\nmildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic \r\npressure is normal. The pulmonary artery is not well visualized. \r\nThere is no pericardial effusion. \r\n Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \r\nleft ventricular systolic dysfunction is now present. Findings \r\nsuggestive of stress cardiomyopathy with inverse Takotsubo \r\npattern of left ventricular contractile dysfunction.  \r\n\r\n___ CTH:\r\nIMPRESSION: \r\n1. There is mild progression of global cerebral atrophy since \r\nthe prior \r\nexamination of ___, greater than would be expected \r\nfor the \r\npatient's age. \r\n2. No intracranial hemorrhage or territorial infarct. \r\n\r\n___ LIVER US:\r\nIMPRESSION:    \r\n1.  Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of \r\nliver disease including steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, or \r\ncirrhosis cannot be excluded on the basis of this examination. \r\n2.  Trace ascites and small right pleural effusion. \r\n\r\n___ IVC filter placement:\r\nFINDINGS:   \r\n1. Patent normal sized, non-duplicated IVC with  no evidence of \r\na IVC \r\nthrombus. A small circumaortic renal vein originating from the \r\nIVC just above the bifurcation was noted however is very small \r\nin caliber and likely of no clinical significance. \r\n2. Successful deployment of an infra-renal retrievable IVC \r\nfilter. \r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\nSuccessful deployment of an infra-renal removable IVC filter. \r\n\r\n___ ECHO:\r\nConclusions   \r\n The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left \r\nventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular \r\nsystolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). Right ventricular \r\nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve \r\nleaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet \r\nexcursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The \r\nmitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral \r\nregurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary \r\nartery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a \r\ntrivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. \r\n IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved \r\nregional and low normal global biventricular systolic function. \r\nNo valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified. Trivial \r\npericardial effusion. \r\n\r\n___ Unilateral RLE veins \r\nIMPRESSION:    \r\nExtensive deep venous thrombosis involving the wall of the right \r\nlower \r\nextremity veins, overall similar to ___, but now with \r\nperhaps minimal flow in the distal right SFV. \r\n\r\n___ Video oropharyngeal swallow study\r\nAspiration with thin liquid consistency.\r\n\r\n___ Portable abdomen x-ray\r\nPatient is post gastric bypass surgery.  The Dobbhoff tube ends \r\nin the \r\nproximal jejunum. \r\n\r\n___ Renal ultrasound\r\nNo evidence of hydronephrosis.  Increased renal echogenicity \r\nconsistent with diffuse parenchymal renal disease.   \r\nSmall bilateral effusions and small to moderate volume ascites. \r\n\r\n___ - EGD\r\nDuodenum was not examined. Small gastric pouch consistent with \r\nRoux en y anatomy the blind limb and jejunal limb were both \r\nvisualized. No varices. Otherwise normal EGD to the jejunum.\r\n\r\n \r\nBrief Hospital Course:\r\n___ hx gastric bypass surgery, alcohol abuse complicated by \r\nWernicke's encephalopathy, concern for autonomic insufficiency, \r\npresented originally with hypotension, anemia and academia. Her \r\ncourse in the MICU was complicated by severe nutritional \r\ndeficiency, volume overload, renal failure, cardiomyopathy, \r\nhypoxemia and hypoxemic respiratory failure, and deep vein \r\nthrombosis.\r\n\r\n# Hypotension:\r\n# Cardiomyopathy: \r\n# Presumed alcoholic liver disease:\r\nPatient was given 4u PRBCs in the ED prior to FICU admission; \r\nher Hgb was stable for days afterward, and there was low \r\nsuspicion for active GIB initially in her MICU course. She was \r\nempirically antiobiosed for concern of sepsis, but no source was \r\nfound, and these antibiotics were held until a series of \r\npresumed aspiration events that will be discussed below. Morning \r\ncortisol was within normal limits twice; TSH was also within \r\nnormal limits. She underwent several echocardiograms to explain \r\nher persistent hypotension with pressor requirement that showed \r\nin sequence: mitral regurgitation with eccentric jet; inverse \r\nTakutsubo's cardiomyopathy; and then resolution of these issues. \r\nOf note, the resolution occurred after initiation of high-dose \r\nthiamine repletion, which may suggest an element of wet \r\nberiberbi from severe nutritional deficiency in the setting of \r\ngastric bypass and alcoholism. There was also strong suspicion \r\nof cirrhosis given her imaging and alcohol abuse history, for \r\nwhich she was started on midodrine. With these measures, she was \r\nsuccessfully weaned from pressors. Unresolved at the time of her \r\nMICU discharge was a question of autonomic insufficiency raised \r\nin her last Discharge Summary of ___ where it was thought her \r\nalcohol abuse could be contributing to baseline systolic \r\npressures in the ___. This in part resolved on the floor as the \r\npatient was weaned off midodrine and maintained systolic blood \r\npressure in the 100s.\r\n\r\n# Anemia: \r\n-Unexplained, possible GI source with lack of erythropoietin in \r\nthe setting of subacute renal failure . Patient had decreasing \r\npRBC transfusion requirements over the course of her stay, \r\nultimately needing 1U pRBC every 4 days. She was evaluated by \r\nHem/Onc who felt there was no evidence of significant hemolysis \r\nor malignancy and felt that there was an element of anemia of \r\nchronic inflammation, as well as decreased erythropoietin in the \r\nsetting of subacute renal failure. She was evaluated by GI who \r\nfound no source of bleed on sigmoidoscopy early in her course \r\nand no varices or bleeding on EGD. She had an episode of guaiac \r\npositive stool but had no significant bleeding on colonoscopy. \r\nPatient may benefit from outpatient capsule study if bleeding is \r\nongoing.\r\n\r\n# Thrombocytopenia: \r\nThere was no evidence of active bleed on presentation (stool \r\nnormal color, not tachycardic, no clinical or radiographic \r\nevidence of extravasation into a compartment). Surgery and GI \r\nwere consulted early in her MICU course for concern of ischemic \r\ngut in the setting of rising lactate, but flexible sigmoidoscopy \r\nwas negative for this and lactate resolved with fluid \r\nresuscitation. ___ Hematology consulted, and believe her \r\nanemia and thrombocytopenia are likely a combination of \r\nalcoholic bone marrow suppression, malnutrition and critical \r\nillness. She may benefit from a bone marrow biopsy when more \r\nstable; additionally, given her renal failure, she may have a \r\ndeveloping EPO deficiency. She was transfused by ED prior to \r\nMICU admission and did not require further blood products until \r\n___ (gradually dropping Hct attributed to anemia of chronic \r\nillness/inflammation/underproduction; she held her Hct each time \r\nafter transfusion).  \r\n\r\n# Diarrhea:\r\nNegative c. diff, improved over the course of the hospital stay. \r\nPossibly related to tube feeding formulas as this improved with \r\nchanging to a higher fiber formula and with the addition of \r\nbanana flakes. Recommend continued loperamide as needed and \r\noptimization of tube feeds in patient s/p gastric bypass.\r\n\r\n# Renal Failure (Addressed Separately Below):\r\nPresented with serum bicarbonate of 8 of unclear etiology. She \r\nmanifested diarrhea in the early part of her ICU stay (C diff \r\nassay negative, thought related to either alcohol abuse or early \r\ncourse of antibiotics administered empirically for presumed \r\nsepsis, resolved); her renal function markers may also have been \r\nunder-estimates of her true GFR given her nutritionally \r\ndeficient state. Acidemia corrected with bicarbonate drip, but \r\nrecurrence remains in a concern in the setting of her renal \r\nfailure with poor UOP. CRRT was started in the setting of volume \r\noverload in the ICU as described above, though she was noted to \r\nhave ATN by muddy brown casts in her urine as well as \r\npersistently poor UOP. At time of FICU discharge she is being \r\ntrialed off CRRT, though with her poor UOP she may need to be \r\ninitiated on standing dialysis. Upon transfer to the floor, her \r\nrenal function did not improve and she remained oliguric. She \r\nwas evaluated by nephrology who felt that ATN without renal \r\nrecovery was the most likely diagnosis based on her urine \r\nsediment and history. A renal biopsy was considered, but \r\nnephrology felt that the risks of the biopsy on a patient \r\nalready requiring heparin for DVT would outweigh the benefits \r\nwith the suspicion of ATN being high already. Urine output \r\nremained low prior to discharge, and tunneled HD line was placed \r\nfor longer-term access.\r\n\r\n# Respiratory Failure:\r\nPatient developed progressive hypoxemia from volume overload \r\neventually requiring CRRT with resolution of the same. However, \r\non ___ she had an unexplained hypoxemic respiratory episode \r\nwith persistent SpO2 measurements in the ___ despite NRB and NC; \r\nshe was intubated with ___ of continued O2 saturations in \r\nthe ___ before resolution not attributable to any particular \r\nintervention (nebs, suction, etc). This first hypoxemic episode \r\nwas attributed to aspiration though subsequent CXR and \r\nbronchoscopy were not impressive for evidence of the same. She \r\nwas extubated within 24hrs, but then reintubated in the setting \r\nof a break in her CRRT line that caused acute hypotension from \r\nblood loss (trapped in the CRRT circuit) and then hypoxemia. \r\nAfter restoration of hemodynamic stability and passing her RSBI, \r\nshe was again extubated, but re-intubated for nearly the same \r\nexact sequence of events that evening(break in the CRRT circuit \r\ndue to equipment failure; this has been reported and is being \r\ninvestigated). She was finally extubated on ___ and remains \r\noff supplemental O2 at time of MICU discharge. Antibiotics were \r\nempirically started in the setting of possible aspiration with \r\nleukocytosis (that could have been a stress reaction to \r\naspiration pneumonitis or intubations/exbuations); these will \r\nfinish on ___. She completed her course of antibiotics and \r\nremained afebrile and without respiratory distress the rest of \r\nher hospitalization. \r\n\r\n# Alcohol Abuse:\r\nPatient endorses heavy alcohol use. She was seen by social work \r\nwho gave resources, though patient is not interested in \r\ncounseling.\r\n\r\n# Severe Nutritional Deficiency:\r\nNutritional deficiencies including zinc and selenium requiring \r\nsignificant repletion. Repeat testing of zinc showed continued \r\nneed for repletion. Caloric needs and repletion addressed below.\r\n\r\n# Severe malnutrition: likely contributor to pancytopenia \r\nresulting from bone marrow suppression. Required tube feeding \r\ntube feed which was continued at discharge in order to meet her \r\ncaloric needs. She was initially found to aspirate thin liquids \r\nby a speech and swallow evaluation, however on reevaluation \r\nafter receiving tube feeds for some time, she was able to \r\ntolerate a regular diet and thin liquids. Her caloric intake by \r\nmouth was not sufficient to decrease tube feeds.\r\n\r\n# Hx Wernicke's Encephalopathy:\r\nPatient had waxing/waning mental status for much of her early \r\nhospital course which was initially attributed to delirium; \r\nhowever, for history of Wernicke's she was started on high-dose \r\nthiamine that seemed to improve her mental status. Nutrition was \r\nconsulted, and nutrition labs were sent that were all markedly \r\nlow. She was supplemented through her TFs and will need to \r\nremain on standing thiamine.\r\n\r\n# Deep Vein Thrombosis:\r\nPatient arrived to MICU with L femoral CVL; shortly thereafter, \r\nasymmetric R > L lower extremity swelling was noticed for which \r\n___ was obtained - this showed extensive venous clot burden in \r\nthe R lower extremity. IV heparin was started. Because of \r\npersistent thrombocytopenia, an IVC filter was placed, though \r\nbecause of her high clot risk IV heparin was continued. She \r\nshould have interval follow-up of her DVTs after discharge, as \r\nwell as scheduled follow-up with ___ for filter removal. She was \r\nmaintained on a heparin drip and should be bridged to Coumadin \r\nto follow up with hematology/oncology as an outpatient.\r\n \r\n# Concern for Gastrointestinal Bleed:\r\nAs described above, GI and Surgery were consulted early in her \r\nMICU stay for rising lactate and concern of gut ischemia in the \r\nsetting of her hypotension; flexible sigmoidoscopy was \r\nunimpressive and lactate improved with pressors and IVF. Near \r\nthe end of her FICU stay she had fresh blood coating a stool \r\nwhich raised concern for GIB; however, her Hct was stable, she \r\nwas HD stable, and guaiacs of subsequent stools were negative \r\nprior to MICU discharge. She underwent evaluation by Hepatology \r\nand EGD which showed no varices, negative colonoscopy. Capsule \r\nstudy failed, but patient's H/H stabilized and hepatology felt \r\nthe study could be done as an outpatient if necessary.\r\n\r\n**Transitional:**\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n-Patient will need daily assessment for hemodialysis needs, EPO \r\nwith HD given renal failure\r\n-Reassess nutritional status and continued need for tube \r\nfeeding, potential need for G-tube\r\n-Daily electrolytes and every other day CBC to evaluate need for \r\nblood transfusion\r\n-Patient on heparin gtt for DVT.

The mediastinal and hilar contours are \r\nnormal. The \r\npulmonary vasculature is normal. Lungs are clear.  No pleural \r\neffusion or \r\npneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  \r\nChain sutures are noted in the left upper quadrant of the \r\nabdomen. \r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\nNo acute cardiopulmonary abnormality \r\n\r\n___ CT abd/pelvis:\r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\n1. No active extravasation of contrast to suggest active GI \r\nbleeding at this time. \r\n2. Profound hepatic steatosis.  Enlarged periportal lymph nodes \r\nwith hazy \r\nmesentery and retroperitoneum likely reflect underlying liver \r\ndisease. \r\n3.  Colonic and rectal wall thickening which may reflect colitis \r\nversus portal colopathy.\r\n4. Heterogeneous appearance of the kidneys with possible \r\nstriated nephrograms. Correlate with urinalysis to exclude \r\npyelonephritis. \r\n\r\n___ TTE:\r\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are \r\nnormal (LVEF = 65%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal \r\nleft ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right \r\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The \r\ndiameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are \r\nnormal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal \r\nwith good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic \r\nregurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. \r\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly myxomatous. Frank mitral \r\nvalve prolapse is not seen but cannot be excluded with \r\ncertainty. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate \r\n(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature \r\nof the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly \r\nunderestimated (Coanda effect). There is borderline pulmonary \r\nartery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.  \r\n\r\n\r\n___ ___\r\nIMPRESSION:   \r\n1. Occlusive thrombus of all right lower extremity deep veins \r\nfrom the common femoral vein down to the calf veins. \r\n2. Patent left lower extremity veins. \r\n\r\n___ ECHO\r\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is \r\nnormal. LV systolic function appears depressed (LVEF = 40%) \r\nsecondary to hypokinesis of the basal two-thirds of the left \r\nventricle. The apical one-third of the left ventricle is \r\nhyperdynamic. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall \r\nmotion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, \r\nascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets \r\n(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No \r\naortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are \r\nmildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic \r\npressure is normal. The pulmonary artery is not well visualized. \r\nThere is no pericardial effusion. \r\n Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \r\nleft ventricular systolic dysfunction is now present. Findings \r\nsuggestive of stress cardiomyopathy with inverse Takotsubo \r\npattern of left ventricular contractile dysfunction.  \r\n\r\n___ CTH:\r\nIMPRESSION: \r\n1. There is mild progression of global cerebral atrophy since \r\nthe prior \r\nexamination of ___, greater than would be expected \r\nfor the \r\npatient's age. \r\n2. No intracranial hemorrhage or territorial infarct. \r\n\r\n___ LIVER US:\r\nIMPRESSION:    \r\n1.  Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of \r\nliver disease including steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, or \r\ncirrhosis cannot be excluded on the basis of this examination. \r\n2.  Trace ascites and small right pleural effusion. \r\n\r\n___ IVC filter placement:\r\nFINDINGS:   \r\n1. Patent normal sized, non-duplicated IVC with  no evidence of \r\na IVC \r\nthrombus. A small circumaortic renal vein originating from the \r\nIVC just above the bifurcation was noted however is very small \r\nin caliber and likely of no clinical significance. \r\n2. Successful deployment of an infra-renal retrievable IVC \r\nfilter. \r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\nSuccessful deployment of an infra-renal removable IVC filter. \r\n\r\n___ ECHO:\r\nConclusions   \r\n The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left \r\nventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular \r\nsystolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). Right ventricular \r\nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve \r\nleaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet \r\nexcursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The \r\nmitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral \r\nregurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary \r\nartery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a \r\ntrivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. \r\n IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved \r\nregional and low normal global biventricular systolic function. \r\nNo valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified. Trivial \r\npericardial effusion. \r\n\r\n___ Unilateral RLE veins \r\nIMPRESSION:    \r\nExtensive deep venous thrombosis involving the wall of the right \r\nlower \r\nextremity veins, overall similar to ___, but now with \r\nperhaps minimal flow in the distal right SFV. \r\n\r\n___ Video oropharyngeal swallow study\r\nAspiration with thin liquid consistency.\r\n\r\n___ Portable abdomen x-ray\r\nPatient is post gastric bypass surgery.  The Dobbhoff tube ends \r\nin the \r\nproximal jejunum. \r\n\r\n___ Renal ultrasound\r\nNo evidence of hydronephrosis.  Increased renal echogenicity \r\nconsistent with diffuse parenchymal renal disease.   \r\nSmall bilateral effusions and small to moderate volume ascites. \r\n\r\n___ - EGD\r\nDuodenum was not examined. Small gastric pouch consistent with \r\nRoux en y anatomy the blind limb and jejunal limb were both \r\nvisualized. No varices. Otherwise normal EGD to the jejunum.\r\n\r\n \r\nBrief Hospital Course:\r\n___ hx gastric bypass surgery, alcohol abuse complicated by \r\nWernicke's encephalopathy, concern for autonomic insufficiency, \r\npresented originally with hypotension, anemia and academia. Her \r\ncourse in the MICU was complicated by severe nutritional \r\ndeficiency, volume overload, renal failure, cardiomyopathy, \r\nhypoxemia and hypoxemic respiratory failure, and deep vein \r\nthrombosis.\r\n\r\n# Hypotension:\r\n# Cardiomyopathy: \r\n# Presumed alcoholic liver disease:\r\nPatient was given 4u PRBCs in the ED prior to FICU admission; \r\nher Hgb was stable for days afterward, and there was low \r\nsuspicion for active GIB initially in her MICU course. She was \r\nempirically antiobiosed for concern of sepsis, but no source was \r\nfound, and these antibiotics were held until a series of \r\npresumed aspiration events that will be discussed below. Morning \r\ncortisol was within normal limits twice; TSH was also within \r\nnormal limits. She underwent several echocardiograms to explain \r\nher persistent hypotension with pressor requirement that showed \r\nin sequence: mitral regurgitation with eccentric jet; inverse \r\nTakutsubo's cardiomyopathy; and then resolution of these issues. \r\nOf note, the resolution occurred after initiation of high-dose \r\nthiamine repletion, which may suggest an element of wet \r\nberiberbi from severe nutritional deficiency in the setting of \r\ngastric bypass and alcoholism. There was also strong suspicion \r\nof cirrhosis given her imaging and alcohol abuse history, for \r\nwhich she was started on midodrine. With these measures, she was \r\nsuccessfully weaned from pressors. Unresolved at the time of her \r\nMICU discharge was a question of autonomic insufficiency raised \r\nin her last Discharge Summary of ___ where it was thought her \r\nalcohol abuse could be contributing to baseline systolic \r\npressures in the ___. This in part resolved on the floor as the \r\npatient was weaned off midodrine and maintained systolic blood \r\npressure in the 100s.\r\n\r\n# Anemia: \r\n-Unexplained, possible GI source with lack of erythropoietin in \r\nthe setting of subacute renal failure . Patient had decreasing \r\npRBC transfusion requirements over the course of her stay, \r\nultimately needing 1U pRBC every 4 days. She was evaluated by \r\nHem/Onc who felt there was no evidence of significant hemolysis \r\nor malignancy and felt that there was an element of anemia of \r\nchronic inflammation, as well as decreased erythropoietin in the \r\nsetting of subacute renal failure. She was evaluated by GI who \r\nfound no source of bleed on sigmoidoscopy early in her course \r\nand no varices or bleeding on EGD. She had an episode of guaiac \r\npositive stool but had no significant bleeding on colonoscopy. \r\nPatient may benefit from outpatient capsule study if bleeding is \r\nongoing.\r\n\r\n# Thrombocytopenia: \r\nThere was no evidence of active bleed on presentation (stool \r\nnormal color, not tachycardic, no clinical or radiographic \r\nevidence of extravasation into a compartment). Surgery and GI \r\nwere consulted early in her MICU course for concern of ischemic \r\ngut in the setting of rising lactate, but flexible sigmoidoscopy \r\nwas negative for this and lactate resolved with fluid \r\nresuscitation. ___ Hematology consulted, and believe her \r\nanemia and thrombocytopenia are likely a combination of \r\nalcoholic bone marrow suppression, malnutrition and critical \r\nillness. She may benefit from a bone marrow biopsy when more \r\nstable; additionally, given her renal failure, she may have a \r\ndeveloping EPO deficiency. She was transfused by ED prior to \r\nMICU admission and did not require further blood products until \r\n___ (gradually dropping Hct attributed to anemia of chronic \r\nillness/inflammation/underproduction; she held her Hct each time \r\nafter transfusion).  \r\n\r\n# Diarrhea:\r\nNegative c. diff, improved over the course of the hospital stay. \r\nPossibly related to tube feeding formulas as this improved with \r\nchanging to a higher fiber formula and with the addition of \r\nbanana flakes. Recommend continued loperamide as needed and \r\noptimization of tube feeds in patient s/p gastric bypass.\r\n\r\n# Renal Failure (Addressed Separately Below):\r\nPresented with serum bicarbonate of 8 of unclear etiology. She \r\nmanifested diarrhea in the early part of her ICU stay (C diff \r\nassay negative, thought related to either alcohol abuse or early \r\ncourse of antibiotics administered empirically for presumed \r\nsepsis, resolved); her renal function markers may also have been \r\nunder-estimates of her true GFR given her nutritionally \r\ndeficient state. Acidemia corrected with bicarbonate drip, but \r\nrecurrence remains in a concern in the setting of her renal \r\nfailure with poor UOP. CRRT was started in the setting of volume \r\noverload in the ICU as described above, though she was noted to \r\nhave ATN by muddy brown casts in her urine as well as \r\npersistently poor UOP. At time of FICU discharge she is being \r\ntrialed off CRRT, though with her poor UOP she may need to be \r\ninitiated on standing dialysis. Upon transfer to the floor, her \r\nrenal function did not improve and she remained oliguric. She \r\nwas evaluated by nephrology who felt that ATN without renal \r\nrecovery was the most likely diagnosis based on her urine \r\nsediment and history. A renal biopsy was considered, but \r\nnephrology felt that the risks of the biopsy on a patient \r\nalready requiring heparin for DVT would outweigh the benefits \r\nwith the suspicion of ATN being high already. Urine output \r\nremained low prior to discharge, and tunneled HD line was placed \r\nfor longer-term access.\r\n\r\n# Respiratory Failure:\r\nPatient developed progressive hypoxemia from volume overload \r\neventually requiring CRRT with resolution of the same. However, \r\non ___ she had an unexplained hypoxemic respiratory episode \r\nwith persistent SpO2 measurements in the ___ despite NRB and NC; \r\nshe was intubated with ___ of continued O2 saturations in \r\nthe ___ before resolution not attributable to any particular \r\nintervention (nebs, suction, etc). This first hypoxemic episode \r\nwas attributed to aspiration though subsequent CXR and \r\nbronchoscopy were not impressive for evidence of the same. She \r\nwas extubated within 24hrs, but then reintubated in the setting \r\nof a break in her CRRT line that caused acute hypotension from \r\nblood loss (trapped in the CRRT circuit) and then hypoxemia. \r\nAfter restoration of hemodynamic stability and passing her RSBI, \r\nshe was again extubated, but re-intubated for nearly the same \r\nexact sequence of events that evening(break in the CRRT circuit \r\ndue to equipment failure; this has been reported and is being \r\ninvestigated). She was finally extubated on ___ and remains \r\noff supplemental O2 at time of MICU discharge. Antibiotics were \r\nempirically started in the setting of possible aspiration with \r\nleukocytosis (that could have been a stress reaction to \r\naspiration pneumonitis or intubations/exbuations); these will \r\nfinish on ___. She completed her course of antibiotics and \r\nremained afebrile and without respiratory distress the rest of \r\nher hospitalization. \r\n\r\n# Alcohol Abuse:\r\nPatient endorses heavy alcohol use. She was seen by social work \r\nwho gave resources, though patient is not interested in \r\ncounseling.\r\n\r\n# Severe Nutritional Deficiency:\r\nNutritional deficiencies including zinc and selenium requiring \r\nsignificant repletion. Repeat testing of zinc showed continued \r\nneed for repletion. Caloric needs and repletion addressed below.\r\n\r\n# Severe malnutrition: likely contributor to pancytopenia \r\nresulting from bone marrow suppression. Required tube feeding \r\ntube feed which was continued at discharge in order to meet her \r\ncaloric needs. She was initially found to aspirate thin liquids \r\nby a speech and swallow evaluation, however on reevaluation \r\nafter receiving tube feeds for some time, she was able to \r\ntolerate a regular diet and thin liquids. Her caloric intake by \r\nmouth was not sufficient to decrease tube feeds.\r\n\r\n# Hx Wernicke's Encephalopathy:\r\nPatient had waxing/waning mental status for much of her early \r\nhospital course which was initially attributed to delirium; \r\nhowever, for history of Wernicke's she was started on high-dose \r\nthiamine that seemed to improve her mental status. Nutrition was \r\nconsulted, and nutrition labs were sent that were all markedly \r\nlow. She was supplemented through her TFs and will need to \r\nremain on standing thiamine.\r\n\r\n# Deep Vein Thrombosis:\r\nPatient arrived to MICU with L femoral CVL; shortly thereafter, \r\nasymmetric R > L lower extremity swelling was noticed for which \r\n___ was obtained - this showed extensive venous clot burden in \r\nthe R lower extremity. IV heparin was started. Because of \r\npersistent thrombocytopenia, an IVC filter was placed, though \r\nbecause of her high clot risk IV heparin was continued. She \r\nshould have interval follow-up of her DVTs after discharge, as \r\nwell as scheduled follow-up with ___ for filter removal. She was \r\nmaintained on a heparin drip and should be bridged to Coumadin \r\nto follow up with hematology/oncology as an outpatient.\r\n \r\n# Concern for Gastrointestinal Bleed:\r\nAs described above, GI and Surgery were consulted early in her \r\nMICU stay for rising lactate and concern of gut ischemia in the \r\nsetting of her hypotension; flexible sigmoidoscopy was \r\nunimpressive and lactate improved with pressors and IVF. Near \r\nthe end of her FICU stay she had fresh blood coating a stool \r\nwhich raised concern for GIB; however, her Hct was stable, she \r\nwas HD stable, and guaiacs of subsequent stools were negative \r\nprior to MICU discharge. She underwent evaluation by Hepatology \r\nand EGD which showed no varices, negative colonoscopy. Capsule \r\nstudy failed, but patient's H/H stabilized and hepatology felt \r\nthe study could be done as an outpatient if necessary.\r\n\r\n**Transitional:**\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n-Patient will need daily assessment for hemodialysis needs, EPO \r\nwith HD given renal failure\r\n-Reassess nutritional status and continued need for tube \r\nfeeding, potential need for G-tube\r\n-Daily electrolytes and every other day CBC to evaluate need for \r\nblood transfusion\r\n-Patient on heparin gtt for DVT.

Of note, the resolution occurred after initiation of high-dose \nthiamine repletion, which may suggest an element of wet \nberiberbi from severe nutritional deficiency in the setting of \ngastric bypass and alcoholism. There was also strong suspicion \nof cirrhosis given her imaging and alcohol abuse history, for \nwhich she was started on midodrine. With these measures, she was \nsuccessfully weaned from pressors. Unresolved at the time of her \nMICU discharge was a question of autonomic insufficiency raised \nin her last Discharge Summary of ___ where it was thought her \nalcohol abuse could be contributing to baseline systolic \npressures in the ___. This in part resolved on the floor as the \npatient was weaned off midodrine and maintained systolic blood \npressure in the 100s. # Anemia: \n-Unexplained, possible GI source with lack of erythropoietin in \nthe setting of subacute renal failure . Patient had decreasing \npRBC transfusion requirements over the course of her stay, \nultimately needing 1U pRBC every 4 days. She was evaluated by \nHem/Onc who felt there was no evidence of significant hemolysis \nor malignancy and felt that there was an element of anemia of \nchronic inflammation, as well as decreased erythropoietin in the \nsetting of subacute renal failure. She was evaluated by GI who \nfound no source of bleed on sigmoidoscopy early in her course \nand no varices or bleeding on EGD. She had an episode of guaiac \npositive stool but had no significant bleeding on colonoscopy. Patient may benefit from outpatient capsule study if bleeding is \nongoing.",

The mediastinal and hilar contours are \r\nnormal. The \r\npulmonary vasculature is normal. Lungs are clear.  No pleural \r\neffusion or \r\npneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  \r\nChain sutures are noted in the left upper quadrant of the \r\nabdomen. \r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\nNo acute cardiopulmonary abnormality \r\n\r\n___ CT abd/pelvis:\r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\n1. No active extravasation of contrast to suggest active GI \r\nbleeding at this time. \r\n2. Profound hepatic steatosis.  Enlarged periportal lymph nodes \r\nwith hazy \r\nmesentery and retroperitoneum likely reflect underlying liver \r\ndisease. \r\n3.  Colonic and rectal wall thickening which may reflect colitis \r\nversus portal colopathy.\r\n4. Heterogeneous appearance of the kidneys with possible \r\nstriated nephrograms. Correlate with urinalysis to exclude \r\npyelonephritis. \r\n\r\n___ TTE:\r\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are \r\nnormal (LVEF = 65%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal \r\nleft ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right \r\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The \r\ndiameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are \r\nnormal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal \r\nwith good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic \r\nregurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. \r\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly myxomatous. Frank mitral \r\nvalve prolapse is not seen but cannot be excluded with \r\ncertainty. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate \r\n(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature \r\nof the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly \r\nunderestimated (Coanda effect). There is borderline pulmonary \r\nartery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.  \r\n\r\n\r\n___ ___\r\nIMPRESSION:   \r\n1. Occlusive thrombus of all right lower extremity deep veins \r\nfrom the common femoral vein down to the calf veins. \r\n2. Patent left lower extremity veins. \r\n\r\n___ ECHO\r\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is \r\nnormal. LV systolic function appears depressed (LVEF = 40%) \r\nsecondary to hypokinesis of the basal two-thirds of the left \r\nventricle. The apical one-third of the left ventricle is \r\nhyperdynamic. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall \r\nmotion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, \r\nascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets \r\n(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No \r\naortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are \r\nmildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic \r\npressure is normal. The pulmonary artery is not well visualized. \r\nThere is no pericardial effusion. \r\n Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \r\nleft ventricular systolic dysfunction is now present. Findings \r\nsuggestive of stress cardiomyopathy with inverse Takotsubo \r\npattern of left ventricular contractile dysfunction.  \r\n\r\n___ CTH:\r\nIMPRESSION: \r\n1. There is mild progression of global cerebral atrophy since \r\nthe prior \r\nexamination of ___, greater than would be expected \r\nfor the \r\npatient's age. \r\n2. No intracranial hemorrhage or territorial infarct. \r\n\r\n___ LIVER US:\r\nIMPRESSION:    \r\n1.  Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of \r\nliver disease including steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, or \r\ncirrhosis cannot be excluded on the basis of this examination. \r\n2.  Trace ascites and small right pleural effusion. \r\n\r\n___ IVC filter placement:\r\nFINDINGS:   \r\n1. Patent normal sized, non-duplicated IVC with  no evidence of \r\na IVC \r\nthrombus. A small circumaortic renal vein originating from the \r\nIVC just above the bifurcation was noted however is very small \r\nin caliber and likely of no clinical significance. \r\n2. Successful deployment of an infra-renal retrievable IVC \r\nfilter. \r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\nSuccessful deployment of an infra-renal removable IVC filter. \r\n\r\n___ ECHO:\r\nConclusions   \r\n The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left \r\nventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular \r\nsystolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). Right ventricular \r\nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve \r\nleaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet \r\nexcursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The \r\nmitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral \r\nregurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary \r\nartery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a \r\ntrivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. \r\n IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved \r\nregional and low normal global biventricular systolic function. \r\nNo valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified. Trivial \r\npericardial effusion. \r\n\r\n___ Unilateral RLE veins \r\nIMPRESSION:    \r\nExtensive deep venous thrombosis involving the wall of the right \r\nlower \r\nextremity veins, overall similar to ___, but now with \r\nperhaps minimal flow in the distal right SFV. \r\n\r\n___ Video oropharyngeal swallow study\r\nAspiration with thin liquid consistency.\r\n\r\n___ Portable abdomen x-ray\r\nPatient is post gastric bypass surgery.  The Dobbhoff tube ends \r\nin the \r\nproximal jejunum. \r\n\r\n___ Renal ultrasound\r\nNo evidence of hydronephrosis.  Increased renal echogenicity \r\nconsistent with diffuse parenchymal renal disease.   \r\nSmall bilateral effusions and small to moderate volume ascites. \r\n\r\n___ - EGD\r\nDuodenum was not examined. Small gastric pouch consistent with \r\nRoux en y anatomy the blind limb and jejunal limb were both \r\nvisualized. No varices. Otherwise normal EGD to the jejunum.\r\n\r\n \r\nBrief Hospital Course:\r\n___ hx gastric bypass surgery, alcohol abuse complicated by \r\nWernicke's encephalopathy, concern for autonomic insufficiency, \r\npresented originally with hypotension, anemia and academia. Her \r\ncourse in the MICU was complicated by severe nutritional \r\ndeficiency, volume overload, renal failure, cardiomyopathy, \r\nhypoxemia and hypoxemic respiratory failure, and deep vein \r\nthrombosis.\r\n\r\n# Hypotension:\r\n# Cardiomyopathy: \r\n# Presumed alcoholic liver disease:\r\nPatient was given 4u PRBCs in the ED prior to FICU admission; \r\nher Hgb was stable for days afterward, and there was low \r\nsuspicion for active GIB initially in her MICU course. She was \r\nempirically antiobiosed for concern of sepsis, but no source was \r\nfound, and these antibiotics were held until a series of \r\npresumed aspiration events that will be discussed below. Morning \r\ncortisol was within normal limits twice; TSH was also within \r\nnormal limits. She underwent several echocardiograms to explain \r\nher persistent hypotension with pressor requirement that showed \r\nin sequence: mitral regurgitation with eccentric jet; inverse \r\nTakutsubo's cardiomyopathy; and then resolution of these issues. \r\nOf note, the resolution occurred after initiation of high-dose \r\nthiamine repletion, which may suggest an element of wet \r\nberiberbi from severe nutritional deficiency in the setting of \r\ngastric bypass and alcoholism. There was also strong suspicion \r\nof cirrhosis given her imaging and alcohol abuse history, for \r\nwhich she was started on midodrine. With these measures, she was \r\nsuccessfully weaned from pressors. Unresolved at the time of her \r\nMICU discharge was a question of autonomic insufficiency raised \r\nin her last Discharge Summary of ___ where it was thought her \r\nalcohol abuse could be contributing to baseline systolic \r\npressures in the ___. This in part resolved on the floor as the \r\npatient was weaned off midodrine and maintained systolic blood \r\npressure in the 100s.\r\n\r\n# Anemia: \r\n-Unexplained, possible GI source with lack of erythropoietin in \r\nthe setting of subacute renal failure . Patient had decreasing \r\npRBC transfusion requirements over the course of her stay, \r\nultimately needing 1U pRBC every 4 days. She was evaluated by \r\nHem/Onc who felt there was no evidence of significant hemolysis \r\nor malignancy and felt that there was an element of anemia of \r\nchronic inflammation, as well as decreased erythropoietin in the \r\nsetting of subacute renal failure. She was evaluated by GI who \r\nfound no source of bleed on sigmoidoscopy early in her course \r\nand no varices or bleeding on EGD. She had an episode of guaiac \r\npositive stool but had no significant bleeding on colonoscopy. \r\nPatient may benefit from outpatient capsule study if bleeding is \r\nongoing.\r\n\r\n# Thrombocytopenia: \r\nThere was no evidence of active bleed on presentation (stool \r\nnormal color, not tachycardic, no clinical or radiographic \r\nevidence of extravasation into a compartment). Surgery and GI \r\nwere consulted early in her MICU course for concern of ischemic \r\ngut in the setting of rising lactate, but flexible sigmoidoscopy \r\nwas negative for this and lactate resolved with fluid \r\nresuscitation. ___ Hematology consulted, and believe her \r\nanemia and thrombocytopenia are likely a combination of \r\nalcoholic bone marrow suppression, malnutrition and critical \r\nillness. She may benefit from a bone marrow biopsy when more \r\nstable; additionally, given her renal failure, she may have a \r\ndeveloping EPO deficiency. She was transfused by ED prior to \r\nMICU admission and did not require further blood products until \r\n___ (gradually dropping Hct attributed to anemia of chronic \r\nillness/inflammation/underproduction; she held her Hct each time \r\nafter transfusion).  \r\n\r\n# Diarrhea:\r\nNegative c. diff, improved over the course of the hospital stay. \r\nPossibly related to tube feeding formulas as this improved with \r\nchanging to a higher fiber formula and with the addition of \r\nbanana flakes. Recommend continued loperamide as needed and \r\noptimization of tube feeds in patient s/p gastric bypass.\r\n\r\n# Renal Failure (Addressed Separately Below):\r\nPresented with serum bicarbonate of 8 of unclear etiology. She \r\nmanifested diarrhea in the early part of her ICU stay (C diff \r\nassay negative, thought related to either alcohol abuse or early \r\ncourse of antibiotics administered empirically for presumed \r\nsepsis, resolved); her renal function markers may also have been \r\nunder-estimates of her true GFR given her nutritionally \r\ndeficient state. Acidemia corrected with bicarbonate drip, but \r\nrecurrence remains in a concern in the setting of her renal \r\nfailure with poor UOP. CRRT was started in the setting of volume \r\noverload in the ICU as described above, though she was noted to \r\nhave ATN by muddy brown casts in her urine as well as \r\npersistently poor UOP. At time of FICU discharge she is being \r\ntrialed off CRRT, though with her poor UOP she may need to be \r\ninitiated on standing dialysis. Upon transfer to the floor, her \r\nrenal function did not improve and she remained oliguric. She \r\nwas evaluated by nephrology who felt that ATN without renal \r\nrecovery was the most likely diagnosis based on her urine \r\nsediment and history. A renal biopsy was considered, but \r\nnephrology felt that the risks of the biopsy on a patient \r\nalready requiring heparin for DVT would outweigh the benefits \r\nwith the suspicion of ATN being high already. Urine output \r\nremained low prior to discharge, and tunneled HD line was placed \r\nfor longer-term access.\r\n\r\n# Respiratory Failure:\r\nPatient developed progressive hypoxemia from volume overload \r\neventually requiring CRRT with resolution of the same. However, \r\non ___ she had an unexplained hypoxemic respiratory episode \r\nwith persistent SpO2 measurements in the ___ despite NRB and NC; \r\nshe was intubated with ___ of continued O2 saturations in \r\nthe ___ before resolution not attributable to any particular \r\nintervention (nebs, suction, etc). This first hypoxemic episode \r\nwas attributed to aspiration though subsequent CXR and \r\nbronchoscopy were not impressive for evidence of the same. She \r\nwas extubated within 24hrs, but then reintubated in the setting \r\nof a break in her CRRT line that caused acute hypotension from \r\nblood loss (trapped in the CRRT circuit) and then hypoxemia. \r\nAfter restoration of hemodynamic stability and passing her RSBI, \r\nshe was again extubated, but re-intubated for nearly the same \r\nexact sequence of events that evening(break in the CRRT circuit \r\ndue to equipment failure; this has been reported and is being \r\ninvestigated). She was finally extubated on ___ and remains \r\noff supplemental O2 at time of MICU discharge. Antibiotics were \r\nempirically started in the setting of possible aspiration with \r\nleukocytosis (that could have been a stress reaction to \r\naspiration pneumonitis or intubations/exbuations); these will \r\nfinish on ___. She completed her course of antibiotics and \r\nremained afebrile and without respiratory distress the rest of \r\nher hospitalization. \r\n\r\n# Alcohol Abuse:\r\nPatient endorses heavy alcohol use. She was seen by social work \r\nwho gave resources, though patient is not interested in \r\ncounseling.\r\n\r\n# Severe Nutritional Deficiency:\r\nNutritional deficiencies including zinc and selenium requiring \r\nsignificant repletion. Repeat testing of zinc showed continued \r\nneed for repletion. Caloric needs and repletion addressed below.\r\n\r\n# Severe malnutrition: likely contributor to pancytopenia \r\nresulting from bone marrow suppression. Required tube feeding \r\ntube feed which was continued at discharge in order to meet her \r\ncaloric needs. She was initially found to aspirate thin liquids \r\nby a speech and swallow evaluation, however on reevaluation \r\nafter receiving tube feeds for some time, she was able to \r\ntolerate a regular diet and thin liquids. Her caloric intake by \r\nmouth was not sufficient to decrease tube feeds.\r\n\r\n# Hx Wernicke's Encephalopathy:\r\nPatient had waxing/waning mental status for much of her early \r\nhospital course which was initially attributed to delirium; \r\nhowever, for history of Wernicke's she was started on high-dose \r\nthiamine that seemed to improve her mental status. Nutrition was \r\nconsulted, and nutrition labs were sent that were all markedly \r\nlow. She was supplemented through her TFs and will need to \r\nremain on standing thiamine.\r\n\r\n# Deep Vein Thrombosis:\r\nPatient arrived to MICU with L femoral CVL; shortly thereafter, \r\nasymmetric R > L lower extremity swelling was noticed for which \r\n___ was obtained - this showed extensive venous clot burden in \r\nthe R lower extremity. IV heparin was started. Because of \r\npersistent thrombocytopenia, an IVC filter was placed, though \r\nbecause of her high clot risk IV heparin was continued. She \r\nshould have interval follow-up of her DVTs after discharge, as \r\nwell as scheduled follow-up with ___ for filter removal. She was \r\nmaintained on a heparin drip and should be bridged to Coumadin \r\nto follow up with hematology/oncology as an outpatient.\r\n \r\n# Concern for Gastrointestinal Bleed:\r\nAs described above, GI and Surgery were consulted early in her \r\nMICU stay for rising lactate and concern of gut ischemia in the \r\nsetting of her hypotension; flexible sigmoidoscopy was \r\nunimpressive and lactate improved with pressors and IVF. Near \r\nthe end of her FICU stay she had fresh blood coating a stool \r\nwhich raised concern for GIB; however, her Hct was stable, she \r\nwas HD stable, and guaiacs of subsequent stools were negative \r\nprior to MICU discharge. She underwent evaluation by Hepatology \r\nand EGD which showed no varices, negative colonoscopy. Capsule \r\nstudy failed, but patient's H/H stabilized and hepatology felt \r\nthe study could be done as an outpatient if necessary.\r\n\r\n**Transitional:**\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n-Patient will need daily assessment for hemodialysis needs, EPO \r\nwith HD given renal failure\r\n-Reassess nutritional status and continued need for tube \r\nfeeding, potential need for G-tube\r\n-Daily electrolytes and every other day CBC to evaluate need for \r\nblood transfusion\r\n-Patient on heparin gtt for DVT.

She was transfused by ED prior to \nMICU admission and did not require further blood products until \n___ (gradually dropping Hct attributed to anemia of chronic \nillness/inflammation/underproduction; she held her Hct each time \nafter transfusion). # Diarrhea:\nNegative c. diff, improved over the course of the hospital stay. Possibly related to tube feeding formulas as this improved with \nchanging to a higher fiber formula and with the addition of \nbanana flakes. Recommend continued loperamide as needed and \noptimization of tube feeds in patient s/p gastric bypass. # Renal Failure (Addressed Separately Below):\nPresented with serum bicarbonate of 8 of unclear etiology. She \nmanifested diarrhea in the early part of her ICU stay (C diff \nassay negative, thought related to either alcohol abuse or early \ncourse of antibiotics administered empirically for presumed \nsepsis, resolved); her renal function markers may also have been \nunder-estimates of her true GFR given her nutritionally \ndeficient state. Acidemia corrected with bicarbonate drip, but \nrecurrence remains in a concern in the setting of her renal \nfailure with poor UOP. CRRT was started in the setting of volume \noverload in the ICU as described above, though she was noted to \nhave ATN by muddy brown casts in her urine as well as \npersistently poor UOP. At time of FICU discharge she is being \ntrialed off CRRT, though with her poor UOP she may need to be \ninitiated on standing dialysis.",

The mediastinal and hilar contours are \r\nnormal. The \r\npulmonary vasculature is normal. Lungs are clear.  No pleural \r\neffusion or \r\npneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  \r\nChain sutures are noted in the left upper quadrant of the \r\nabdomen. \r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\nNo acute cardiopulmonary abnormality \r\n\r\n___ CT abd/pelvis:\r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\n1. No active extravasation of contrast to suggest active GI \r\nbleeding at this time. \r\n2. Profound hepatic steatosis.  Enlarged periportal lymph nodes \r\nwith hazy \r\nmesentery and retroperitoneum likely reflect underlying liver \r\ndisease. \r\n3.  Colonic and rectal wall thickening which may reflect colitis \r\nversus portal colopathy.\r\n4. Heterogeneous appearance of the kidneys with possible \r\nstriated nephrograms. Correlate with urinalysis to exclude \r\npyelonephritis. \r\n\r\n___ TTE:\r\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are \r\nnormal (LVEF = 65%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal \r\nleft ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right \r\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The \r\ndiameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are \r\nnormal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal \r\nwith good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic \r\nregurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. \r\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly myxomatous. Frank mitral \r\nvalve prolapse is not seen but cannot be excluded with \r\ncertainty. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate \r\n(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature \r\nof the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly \r\nunderestimated (Coanda effect). There is borderline pulmonary \r\nartery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.  \r\n\r\n\r\n___ ___\r\nIMPRESSION:   \r\n1. Occlusive thrombus of all right lower extremity deep veins \r\nfrom the common femoral vein down to the calf veins. \r\n2. Patent left lower extremity veins. \r\n\r\n___ ECHO\r\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is \r\nnormal. LV systolic function appears depressed (LVEF = 40%) \r\nsecondary to hypokinesis of the basal two-thirds of the left \r\nventricle. The apical one-third of the left ventricle is \r\nhyperdynamic. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall \r\nmotion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, \r\nascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets \r\n(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No \r\naortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are \r\nmildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic \r\npressure is normal. The pulmonary artery is not well visualized. \r\nThere is no pericardial effusion. \r\n Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \r\nleft ventricular systolic dysfunction is now present. Findings \r\nsuggestive of stress cardiomyopathy with inverse Takotsubo \r\npattern of left ventricular contractile dysfunction.  \r\n\r\n___ CTH:\r\nIMPRESSION: \r\n1. There is mild progression of global cerebral atrophy since \r\nthe prior \r\nexamination of ___, greater than would be expected \r\nfor the \r\npatient's age. \r\n2. No intracranial hemorrhage or territorial infarct. \r\n\r\n___ LIVER US:\r\nIMPRESSION:    \r\n1.  Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of \r\nliver disease including steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, or \r\ncirrhosis cannot be excluded on the basis of this examination. \r\n2.  Trace ascites and small right pleural effusion. \r\n\r\n___ IVC filter placement:\r\nFINDINGS:   \r\n1. Patent normal sized, non-duplicated IVC with  no evidence of \r\na IVC \r\nthrombus. A small circumaortic renal vein originating from the \r\nIVC just above the bifurcation was noted however is very small \r\nin caliber and likely of no clinical significance. \r\n2. Successful deployment of an infra-renal retrievable IVC \r\nfilter. \r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\nSuccessful deployment of an infra-renal removable IVC filter. \r\n\r\n___ ECHO:\r\nConclusions   \r\n The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left \r\nventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular \r\nsystolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). Right ventricular \r\nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve \r\nleaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet \r\nexcursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The \r\nmitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral \r\nregurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary \r\nartery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a \r\ntrivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. \r\n IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved \r\nregional and low normal global biventricular systolic function. \r\nNo valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified. Trivial \r\npericardial effusion. \r\n\r\n___ Unilateral RLE veins \r\nIMPRESSION:    \r\nExtensive deep venous thrombosis involving the wall of the right \r\nlower \r\nextremity veins, overall similar to ___, but now with \r\nperhaps minimal flow in the distal right SFV. \r\n\r\n___ Video oropharyngeal swallow study\r\nAspiration with thin liquid consistency.\r\n\r\n___ Portable abdomen x-ray\r\nPatient is post gastric bypass surgery.  The Dobbhoff tube ends \r\nin the \r\nproximal jejunum. \r\n\r\n___ Renal ultrasound\r\nNo evidence of hydronephrosis.  Increased renal echogenicity \r\nconsistent with diffuse parenchymal renal disease.   \r\nSmall bilateral effusions and small to moderate volume ascites. \r\n\r\n___ - EGD\r\nDuodenum was not examined. Small gastric pouch consistent with \r\nRoux en y anatomy the blind limb and jejunal limb were both \r\nvisualized. No varices. Otherwise normal EGD to the jejunum.\r\n\r\n \r\nBrief Hospital Course:\r\n___ hx gastric bypass surgery, alcohol abuse complicated by \r\nWernicke's encephalopathy, concern for autonomic insufficiency, \r\npresented originally with hypotension, anemia and academia. Her \r\ncourse in the MICU was complicated by severe nutritional \r\ndeficiency, volume overload, renal failure, cardiomyopathy, \r\nhypoxemia and hypoxemic respiratory failure, and deep vein \r\nthrombosis.\r\n\r\n# Hypotension:\r\n# Cardiomyopathy: \r\n# Presumed alcoholic liver disease:\r\nPatient was given 4u PRBCs in the ED prior to FICU admission; \r\nher Hgb was stable for days afterward, and there was low \r\nsuspicion for active GIB initially in her MICU course. She was \r\nempirically antiobiosed for concern of sepsis, but no source was \r\nfound, and these antibiotics were held until a series of \r\npresumed aspiration events that will be discussed below. Morning \r\ncortisol was within normal limits twice; TSH was also within \r\nnormal limits. She underwent several echocardiograms to explain \r\nher persistent hypotension with pressor requirement that showed \r\nin sequence: mitral regurgitation with eccentric jet; inverse \r\nTakutsubo's cardiomyopathy; and then resolution of these issues. \r\nOf note, the resolution occurred after initiation of high-dose \r\nthiamine repletion, which may suggest an element of wet \r\nberiberbi from severe nutritional deficiency in the setting of \r\ngastric bypass and alcoholism. There was also strong suspicion \r\nof cirrhosis given her imaging and alcohol abuse history, for \r\nwhich she was started on midodrine. With these measures, she was \r\nsuccessfully weaned from pressors. Unresolved at the time of her \r\nMICU discharge was a question of autonomic insufficiency raised \r\nin her last Discharge Summary of ___ where it was thought her \r\nalcohol abuse could be contributing to baseline systolic \r\npressures in the ___. This in part resolved on the floor as the \r\npatient was weaned off midodrine and maintained systolic blood \r\npressure in the 100s.\r\n\r\n# Anemia: \r\n-Unexplained, possible GI source with lack of erythropoietin in \r\nthe setting of subacute renal failure . Patient had decreasing \r\npRBC transfusion requirements over the course of her stay, \r\nultimately needing 1U pRBC every 4 days. She was evaluated by \r\nHem/Onc who felt there was no evidence of significant hemolysis \r\nor malignancy and felt that there was an element of anemia of \r\nchronic inflammation, as well as decreased erythropoietin in the \r\nsetting of subacute renal failure. She was evaluated by GI who \r\nfound no source of bleed on sigmoidoscopy early in her course \r\nand no varices or bleeding on EGD. She had an episode of guaiac \r\npositive stool but had no significant bleeding on colonoscopy. \r\nPatient may benefit from outpatient capsule study if bleeding is \r\nongoing.\r\n\r\n# Thrombocytopenia: \r\nThere was no evidence of active bleed on presentation (stool \r\nnormal color, not tachycardic, no clinical or radiographic \r\nevidence of extravasation into a compartment). Surgery and GI \r\nwere consulted early in her MICU course for concern of ischemic \r\ngut in the setting of rising lactate, but flexible sigmoidoscopy \r\nwas negative for this and lactate resolved with fluid \r\nresuscitation. ___ Hematology consulted, and believe her \r\nanemia and thrombocytopenia are likely a combination of \r\nalcoholic bone marrow suppression, malnutrition and critical \r\nillness. She may benefit from a bone marrow biopsy when more \r\nstable; additionally, given her renal failure, she may have a \r\ndeveloping EPO deficiency. She was transfused by ED prior to \r\nMICU admission and did not require further blood products until \r\n___ (gradually dropping Hct attributed to anemia of chronic \r\nillness/inflammation/underproduction; she held her Hct each time \r\nafter transfusion).  \r\n\r\n# Diarrhea:\r\nNegative c. diff, improved over the course of the hospital stay. \r\nPossibly related to tube feeding formulas as this improved with \r\nchanging to a higher fiber formula and with the addition of \r\nbanana flakes. Recommend continued loperamide as needed and \r\noptimization of tube feeds in patient s/p gastric bypass.\r\n\r\n# Renal Failure (Addressed Separately Below):\r\nPresented with serum bicarbonate of 8 of unclear etiology. She \r\nmanifested diarrhea in the early part of her ICU stay (C diff \r\nassay negative, thought related to either alcohol abuse or early \r\ncourse of antibiotics administered empirically for presumed \r\nsepsis, resolved); her renal function markers may also have been \r\nunder-estimates of her true GFR given her nutritionally \r\ndeficient state. Acidemia corrected with bicarbonate drip, but \r\nrecurrence remains in a concern in the setting of her renal \r\nfailure with poor UOP. CRRT was started in the setting of volume \r\noverload in the ICU as described above, though she was noted to \r\nhave ATN by muddy brown casts in her urine as well as \r\npersistently poor UOP. At time of FICU discharge she is being \r\ntrialed off CRRT, though with her poor UOP she may need to be \r\ninitiated on standing dialysis. Upon transfer to the floor, her \r\nrenal function did not improve and she remained oliguric. She \r\nwas evaluated by nephrology who felt that ATN without renal \r\nrecovery was the most likely diagnosis based on her urine \r\nsediment and history. A renal biopsy was considered, but \r\nnephrology felt that the risks of the biopsy on a patient \r\nalready requiring heparin for DVT would outweigh the benefits \r\nwith the suspicion of ATN being high already. Urine output \r\nremained low prior to discharge, and tunneled HD line was placed \r\nfor longer-term access.\r\n\r\n# Respiratory Failure:\r\nPatient developed progressive hypoxemia from volume overload \r\neventually requiring CRRT with resolution of the same. However, \r\non ___ she had an unexplained hypoxemic respiratory episode \r\nwith persistent SpO2 measurements in the ___ despite NRB and NC; \r\nshe was intubated with ___ of continued O2 saturations in \r\nthe ___ before resolution not attributable to any particular \r\nintervention (nebs, suction, etc). This first hypoxemic episode \r\nwas attributed to aspiration though subsequent CXR and \r\nbronchoscopy were not impressive for evidence of the same. She \r\nwas extubated within 24hrs, but then reintubated in the setting \r\nof a break in her CRRT line that caused acute hypotension from \r\nblood loss (trapped in the CRRT circuit) and then hypoxemia. \r\nAfter restoration of hemodynamic stability and passing her RSBI, \r\nshe was again extubated, but re-intubated for nearly the same \r\nexact sequence of events that evening(break in the CRRT circuit \r\ndue to equipment failure; this has been reported and is being \r\ninvestigated). She was finally extubated on ___ and remains \r\noff supplemental O2 at time of MICU discharge. Antibiotics were \r\nempirically started in the setting of possible aspiration with \r\nleukocytosis (that could have been a stress reaction to \r\naspiration pneumonitis or intubations/exbuations); these will \r\nfinish on ___. She completed her course of antibiotics and \r\nremained afebrile and without respiratory distress the rest of \r\nher hospitalization. \r\n\r\n# Alcohol Abuse:\r\nPatient endorses heavy alcohol use. She was seen by social work \r\nwho gave resources, though patient is not interested in \r\ncounseling.\r\n\r\n# Severe Nutritional Deficiency:\r\nNutritional deficiencies including zinc and selenium requiring \r\nsignificant repletion. Repeat testing of zinc showed continued \r\nneed for repletion. Caloric needs and repletion addressed below.\r\n\r\n# Severe malnutrition: likely contributor to pancytopenia \r\nresulting from bone marrow suppression. Required tube feeding \r\ntube feed which was continued at discharge in order to meet her \r\ncaloric needs. She was initially found to aspirate thin liquids \r\nby a speech and swallow evaluation, however on reevaluation \r\nafter receiving tube feeds for some time, she was able to \r\ntolerate a regular diet and thin liquids. Her caloric intake by \r\nmouth was not sufficient to decrease tube feeds.\r\n\r\n# Hx Wernicke's Encephalopathy:\r\nPatient had waxing/waning mental status for much of her early \r\nhospital course which was initially attributed to delirium; \r\nhowever, for history of Wernicke's she was started on high-dose \r\nthiamine that seemed to improve her mental status. Nutrition was \r\nconsulted, and nutrition labs were sent that were all markedly \r\nlow. She was supplemented through her TFs and will need to \r\nremain on standing thiamine.\r\n\r\n# Deep Vein Thrombosis:\r\nPatient arrived to MICU with L femoral CVL; shortly thereafter, \r\nasymmetric R > L lower extremity swelling was noticed for which \r\n___ was obtained - this showed extensive venous clot burden in \r\nthe R lower extremity. IV heparin was started. Because of \r\npersistent thrombocytopenia, an IVC filter was placed, though \r\nbecause of her high clot risk IV heparin was continued. She \r\nshould have interval follow-up of her DVTs after discharge, as \r\nwell as scheduled follow-up with ___ for filter removal. She was \r\nmaintained on a heparin drip and should be bridged to Coumadin \r\nto follow up with hematology/oncology as an outpatient.\r\n \r\n# Concern for Gastrointestinal Bleed:\r\nAs described above, GI and Surgery were consulted early in her \r\nMICU stay for rising lactate and concern of gut ischemia in the \r\nsetting of her hypotension; flexible sigmoidoscopy was \r\nunimpressive and lactate improved with pressors and IVF. Near \r\nthe end of her FICU stay she had fresh blood coating a stool \r\nwhich raised concern for GIB; however, her Hct was stable, she \r\nwas HD stable, and guaiacs of subsequent stools were negative \r\nprior to MICU discharge. She underwent evaluation by Hepatology \r\nand EGD which showed no varices, negative colonoscopy. Capsule \r\nstudy failed, but patient's H/H stabilized and hepatology felt \r\nthe study could be done as an outpatient if necessary.\r\n\r\n**Transitional:**\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n-Patient will need daily assessment for hemodialysis needs, EPO \r\nwith HD given renal failure\r\n-Reassess nutritional status and continued need for tube \r\nfeeding, potential need for G-tube\r\n-Daily electrolytes and every other day CBC to evaluate need for \r\nblood transfusion\r\n-Patient on heparin gtt for DVT.

However, \non ___ she had an unexplained hypoxemic respiratory episode \nwith persistent SpO2 measurements in the ___ despite NRB and NC; \nshe was intubated with ___ of continued O2 saturations in \nthe ___ before resolution not attributable to any particular \nintervention (nebs, suction, etc). This first hypoxemic episode \nwas attributed to aspiration though subsequent CXR and \nbronchoscopy were not impressive for evidence of the same. She \nwas extubated within 24hrs, but then reintubated in the setting \nof a break in her CRRT line that caused acute hypotension from \nblood loss (trapped in the CRRT circuit) and then hypoxemia. After restoration of hemodynamic stability and passing her RSBI, \nshe was again extubated, but re-intubated for nearly the same \nexact sequence of events that evening(break in the CRRT circuit \ndue to equipment failure; this has been reported and is being \ninvestigated). She was finally extubated on ___ and remains \noff supplemental O2 at time of MICU discharge. Antibiotics were \nempirically started in the setting of possible aspiration with \nleukocytosis (that could have been a stress reaction to \naspiration pneumonitis or intubations/exbuations); these will \nfinish on ___. She completed her course of antibiotics and \nremained afebrile and without respiratory distress the rest of \nher hospitalization. # Alcohol Abuse:\nPatient endorses heavy alcohol use. She was seen by social work \nwho gave resources, though patient is not interested in \ncounseling. # Severe Nutritional Deficiency:\nNutritional deficiencies including zinc and selenium requiring \nsignificant repletion.",

The mediastinal and hilar contours are \r\nnormal. The \r\npulmonary vasculature is normal. Lungs are clear.  No pleural \r\neffusion or \r\npneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  \r\nChain sutures are noted in the left upper quadrant of the \r\nabdomen. \r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\nNo acute cardiopulmonary abnormality \r\n\r\n___ CT abd/pelvis:\r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\n1. No active extravasation of contrast to suggest active GI \r\nbleeding at this time. \r\n2. Profound hepatic steatosis.  Enlarged periportal lymph nodes \r\nwith hazy \r\nmesentery and retroperitoneum likely reflect underlying liver \r\ndisease. \r\n3.  Colonic and rectal wall thickening which may reflect colitis \r\nversus portal colopathy.\r\n4. Heterogeneous appearance of the kidneys with possible \r\nstriated nephrograms. Correlate with urinalysis to exclude \r\npyelonephritis. \r\n\r\n___ TTE:\r\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are \r\nnormal (LVEF = 65%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal \r\nleft ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right \r\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The \r\ndiameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are \r\nnormal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal \r\nwith good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic \r\nregurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. \r\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly myxomatous. Frank mitral \r\nvalve prolapse is not seen but cannot be excluded with \r\ncertainty. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate \r\n(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature \r\nof the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly \r\nunderestimated (Coanda effect). There is borderline pulmonary \r\nartery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.  \r\n\r\n\r\n___ ___\r\nIMPRESSION:   \r\n1. Occlusive thrombus of all right lower extremity deep veins \r\nfrom the common femoral vein down to the calf veins. \r\n2. Patent left lower extremity veins. \r\n\r\n___ ECHO\r\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is \r\nnormal. LV systolic function appears depressed (LVEF = 40%) \r\nsecondary to hypokinesis of the basal two-thirds of the left \r\nventricle. The apical one-third of the left ventricle is \r\nhyperdynamic. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall \r\nmotion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, \r\nascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets \r\n(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No \r\naortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are \r\nmildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic \r\npressure is normal. The pulmonary artery is not well visualized. \r\nThere is no pericardial effusion. \r\n Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \r\nleft ventricular systolic dysfunction is now present. Findings \r\nsuggestive of stress cardiomyopathy with inverse Takotsubo \r\npattern of left ventricular contractile dysfunction.  \r\n\r\n___ CTH:\r\nIMPRESSION: \r\n1. There is mild progression of global cerebral atrophy since \r\nthe prior \r\nexamination of ___, greater than would be expected \r\nfor the \r\npatient's age. \r\n2. No intracranial hemorrhage or territorial infarct. \r\n\r\n___ LIVER US:\r\nIMPRESSION:    \r\n1.  Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of \r\nliver disease including steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, or \r\ncirrhosis cannot be excluded on the basis of this examination. \r\n2.  Trace ascites and small right pleural effusion. \r\n\r\n___ IVC filter placement:\r\nFINDINGS:   \r\n1. Patent normal sized, non-duplicated IVC with  no evidence of \r\na IVC \r\nthrombus. A small circumaortic renal vein originating from the \r\nIVC just above the bifurcation was noted however is very small \r\nin caliber and likely of no clinical significance. \r\n2. Successful deployment of an infra-renal retrievable IVC \r\nfilter. \r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\nSuccessful deployment of an infra-renal removable IVC filter. \r\n\r\n___ ECHO:\r\nConclusions   \r\n The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left \r\nventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular \r\nsystolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). Right ventricular \r\nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve \r\nleaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet \r\nexcursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The \r\nmitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral \r\nregurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary \r\nartery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a \r\ntrivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. \r\n IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved \r\nregional and low normal global biventricular systolic function. \r\nNo valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified. Trivial \r\npericardial effusion. \r\n\r\n___ Unilateral RLE veins \r\nIMPRESSION:    \r\nExtensive deep venous thrombosis involving the wall of the right \r\nlower \r\nextremity veins, overall similar to ___, but now with \r\nperhaps minimal flow in the distal right SFV. \r\n\r\n___ Video oropharyngeal swallow study\r\nAspiration with thin liquid consistency.\r\n\r\n___ Portable abdomen x-ray\r\nPatient is post gastric bypass surgery.  The Dobbhoff tube ends \r\nin the \r\nproximal jejunum. \r\n\r\n___ Renal ultrasound\r\nNo evidence of hydronephrosis.  Increased renal echogenicity \r\nconsistent with diffuse parenchymal renal disease.   \r\nSmall bilateral effusions and small to moderate volume ascites. \r\n\r\n___ - EGD\r\nDuodenum was not examined. Small gastric pouch consistent with \r\nRoux en y anatomy the blind limb and jejunal limb were both \r\nvisualized. No varices. Otherwise normal EGD to the jejunum.\r\n\r\n \r\nBrief Hospital Course:\r\n___ hx gastric bypass surgery, alcohol abuse complicated by \r\nWernicke's encephalopathy, concern for autonomic insufficiency, \r\npresented originally with hypotension, anemia and academia. Her \r\ncourse in the MICU was complicated by severe nutritional \r\ndeficiency, volume overload, renal failure, cardiomyopathy, \r\nhypoxemia and hypoxemic respiratory failure, and deep vein \r\nthrombosis.\r\n\r\n# Hypotension:\r\n# Cardiomyopathy: \r\n# Presumed alcoholic liver disease:\r\nPatient was given 4u PRBCs in the ED prior to FICU admission; \r\nher Hgb was stable for days afterward, and there was low \r\nsuspicion for active GIB initially in her MICU course. She was \r\nempirically antiobiosed for concern of sepsis, but no source was \r\nfound, and these antibiotics were held until a series of \r\npresumed aspiration events that will be discussed below. Morning \r\ncortisol was within normal limits twice; TSH was also within \r\nnormal limits. She underwent several echocardiograms to explain \r\nher persistent hypotension with pressor requirement that showed \r\nin sequence: mitral regurgitation with eccentric jet; inverse \r\nTakutsubo's cardiomyopathy; and then resolution of these issues. \r\nOf note, the resolution occurred after initiation of high-dose \r\nthiamine repletion, which may suggest an element of wet \r\nberiberbi from severe nutritional deficiency in the setting of \r\ngastric bypass and alcoholism. There was also strong suspicion \r\nof cirrhosis given her imaging and alcohol abuse history, for \r\nwhich she was started on midodrine. With these measures, she was \r\nsuccessfully weaned from pressors. Unresolved at the time of her \r\nMICU discharge was a question of autonomic insufficiency raised \r\nin her last Discharge Summary of ___ where it was thought her \r\nalcohol abuse could be contributing to baseline systolic \r\npressures in the ___. This in part resolved on the floor as the \r\npatient was weaned off midodrine and maintained systolic blood \r\npressure in the 100s.\r\n\r\n# Anemia: \r\n-Unexplained, possible GI source with lack of erythropoietin in \r\nthe setting of subacute renal failure . Patient had decreasing \r\npRBC transfusion requirements over the course of her stay, \r\nultimately needing 1U pRBC every 4 days. She was evaluated by \r\nHem/Onc who felt there was no evidence of significant hemolysis \r\nor malignancy and felt that there was an element of anemia of \r\nchronic inflammation, as well as decreased erythropoietin in the \r\nsetting of subacute renal failure. She was evaluated by GI who \r\nfound no source of bleed on sigmoidoscopy early in her course \r\nand no varices or bleeding on EGD. She had an episode of guaiac \r\npositive stool but had no significant bleeding on colonoscopy. \r\nPatient may benefit from outpatient capsule study if bleeding is \r\nongoing.\r\n\r\n# Thrombocytopenia: \r\nThere was no evidence of active bleed on presentation (stool \r\nnormal color, not tachycardic, no clinical or radiographic \r\nevidence of extravasation into a compartment). Surgery and GI \r\nwere consulted early in her MICU course for concern of ischemic \r\ngut in the setting of rising lactate, but flexible sigmoidoscopy \r\nwas negative for this and lactate resolved with fluid \r\nresuscitation. ___ Hematology consulted, and believe her \r\nanemia and thrombocytopenia are likely a combination of \r\nalcoholic bone marrow suppression, malnutrition and critical \r\nillness. She may benefit from a bone marrow biopsy when more \r\nstable; additionally, given her renal failure, she may have a \r\ndeveloping EPO deficiency. She was transfused by ED prior to \r\nMICU admission and did not require further blood products until \r\n___ (gradually dropping Hct attributed to anemia of chronic \r\nillness/inflammation/underproduction; she held her Hct each time \r\nafter transfusion).  \r\n\r\n# Diarrhea:\r\nNegative c. diff, improved over the course of the hospital stay. \r\nPossibly related to tube feeding formulas as this improved with \r\nchanging to a higher fiber formula and with the addition of \r\nbanana flakes. Recommend continued loperamide as needed and \r\noptimization of tube feeds in patient s/p gastric bypass.\r\n\r\n# Renal Failure (Addressed Separately Below):\r\nPresented with serum bicarbonate of 8 of unclear etiology. She \r\nmanifested diarrhea in the early part of her ICU stay (C diff \r\nassay negative, thought related to either alcohol abuse or early \r\ncourse of antibiotics administered empirically for presumed \r\nsepsis, resolved); her renal function markers may also have been \r\nunder-estimates of her true GFR given her nutritionally \r\ndeficient state. Acidemia corrected with bicarbonate drip, but \r\nrecurrence remains in a concern in the setting of her renal \r\nfailure with poor UOP. CRRT was started in the setting of volume \r\noverload in the ICU as described above, though she was noted to \r\nhave ATN by muddy brown casts in her urine as well as \r\npersistently poor UOP. At time of FICU discharge she is being \r\ntrialed off CRRT, though with her poor UOP she may need to be \r\ninitiated on standing dialysis. Upon transfer to the floor, her \r\nrenal function did not improve and she remained oliguric. She \r\nwas evaluated by nephrology who felt that ATN without renal \r\nrecovery was the most likely diagnosis based on her urine \r\nsediment and history. A renal biopsy was considered, but \r\nnephrology felt that the risks of the biopsy on a patient \r\nalready requiring heparin for DVT would outweigh the benefits \r\nwith the suspicion of ATN being high already. Urine output \r\nremained low prior to discharge, and tunneled HD line was placed \r\nfor longer-term access.\r\n\r\n# Respiratory Failure:\r\nPatient developed progressive hypoxemia from volume overload \r\neventually requiring CRRT with resolution of the same. However, \r\non ___ she had an unexplained hypoxemic respiratory episode \r\nwith persistent SpO2 measurements in the ___ despite NRB and NC; \r\nshe was intubated with ___ of continued O2 saturations in \r\nthe ___ before resolution not attributable to any particular \r\nintervention (nebs, suction, etc). This first hypoxemic episode \r\nwas attributed to aspiration though subsequent CXR and \r\nbronchoscopy were not impressive for evidence of the same. She \r\nwas extubated within 24hrs, but then reintubated in the setting \r\nof a break in her CRRT line that caused acute hypotension from \r\nblood loss (trapped in the CRRT circuit) and then hypoxemia. \r\nAfter restoration of hemodynamic stability and passing her RSBI, \r\nshe was again extubated, but re-intubated for nearly the same \r\nexact sequence of events that evening(break in the CRRT circuit \r\ndue to equipment failure; this has been reported and is being \r\ninvestigated). She was finally extubated on ___ and remains \r\noff supplemental O2 at time of MICU discharge. Antibiotics were \r\nempirically started in the setting of possible aspiration with \r\nleukocytosis (that could have been a stress reaction to \r\naspiration pneumonitis or intubations/exbuations); these will \r\nfinish on ___. She completed her course of antibiotics and \r\nremained afebrile and without respiratory distress the rest of \r\nher hospitalization. \r\n\r\n# Alcohol Abuse:\r\nPatient endorses heavy alcohol use. She was seen by social work \r\nwho gave resources, though patient is not interested in \r\ncounseling.\r\n\r\n# Severe Nutritional Deficiency:\r\nNutritional deficiencies including zinc and selenium requiring \r\nsignificant repletion. Repeat testing of zinc showed continued \r\nneed for repletion. Caloric needs and repletion addressed below.\r\n\r\n# Severe malnutrition: likely contributor to pancytopenia \r\nresulting from bone marrow suppression. Required tube feeding \r\ntube feed which was continued at discharge in order to meet her \r\ncaloric needs. She was initially found to aspirate thin liquids \r\nby a speech and swallow evaluation, however on reevaluation \r\nafter receiving tube feeds for some time, she was able to \r\ntolerate a regular diet and thin liquids. Her caloric intake by \r\nmouth was not sufficient to decrease tube feeds.\r\n\r\n# Hx Wernicke's Encephalopathy:\r\nPatient had waxing/waning mental status for much of her early \r\nhospital course which was initially attributed to delirium; \r\nhowever, for history of Wernicke's she was started on high-dose \r\nthiamine that seemed to improve her mental status. Nutrition was \r\nconsulted, and nutrition labs were sent that were all markedly \r\nlow. She was supplemented through her TFs and will need to \r\nremain on standing thiamine.\r\n\r\n# Deep Vein Thrombosis:\r\nPatient arrived to MICU with L femoral CVL; shortly thereafter, \r\nasymmetric R > L lower extremity swelling was noticed for which \r\n___ was obtained - this showed extensive venous clot burden in \r\nthe R lower extremity. IV heparin was started. Because of \r\npersistent thrombocytopenia, an IVC filter was placed, though \r\nbecause of her high clot risk IV heparin was continued. She \r\nshould have interval follow-up of her DVTs after discharge, as \r\nwell as scheduled follow-up with ___ for filter removal. She was \r\nmaintained on a heparin drip and should be bridged to Coumadin \r\nto follow up with hematology/oncology as an outpatient.\r\n \r\n# Concern for Gastrointestinal Bleed:\r\nAs described above, GI and Surgery were consulted early in her \r\nMICU stay for rising lactate and concern of gut ischemia in the \r\nsetting of her hypotension; flexible sigmoidoscopy was \r\nunimpressive and lactate improved with pressors and IVF. Near \r\nthe end of her FICU stay she had fresh blood coating a stool \r\nwhich raised concern for GIB; however, her Hct was stable, she \r\nwas HD stable, and guaiacs of subsequent stools were negative \r\nprior to MICU discharge. She underwent evaluation by Hepatology \r\nand EGD which showed no varices, negative colonoscopy. Capsule \r\nstudy failed, but patient's H/H stabilized and hepatology felt \r\nthe study could be done as an outpatient if necessary.\r\n\r\n**Transitional:**\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n-Patient will need daily assessment for hemodialysis needs, EPO \r\nwith HD given renal failure\r\n-Reassess nutritional status and continued need for tube \r\nfeeding, potential need for G-tube\r\n-Daily electrolytes and every other day CBC to evaluate need for \r\nblood transfusion\r\n-Patient on heparin gtt for DVT.

She was supplemented through her TFs and will need to \nremain on standing thiamine. # Deep Vein Thrombosis:\nPatient arrived to MICU with L femoral CVL; shortly thereafter, \nasymmetric R > L lower extremity swelling was noticed for which \n___ was obtained - this showed extensive venous clot burden in \nthe R lower extremity. IV heparin was started. Because of \npersistent thrombocytopenia, an IVC filter was placed, though \nbecause of her high clot risk IV heparin was continued. She \nshould have interval follow-up of her DVTs after discharge, as \nwell as scheduled follow-up with ___ for filter removal. She was \nmaintained on a heparin drip and should be bridged to Coumadin \nto follow up with hematology/oncology as an outpatient. # Concern for Gastrointestinal Bleed:\nAs described above, GI and Surgery were consulted early in her \nMICU stay for rising lactate and concern of gut ischemia in the \nsetting of her hypotension; flexible sigmoidoscopy was \nunimpressive and lactate improved with pressors and IVF. Near \nthe end of her FICU stay she had fresh blood coating a stool \nwhich raised concern for GIB; however, her Hct was stable, she \nwas HD stable, and guaiacs of subsequent stools were negative \nprior to MICU discharge. She underwent evaluation by Hepatology \nand EGD which showed no varices, negative colonoscopy.",

The mediastinal and hilar contours are \r\nnormal. The \r\npulmonary vasculature is normal. Lungs are clear.  No pleural \r\neffusion or \r\npneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  \r\nChain sutures are noted in the left upper quadrant of the \r\nabdomen. \r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\nNo acute cardiopulmonary abnormality \r\n\r\n___ CT abd/pelvis:\r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\n1. No active extravasation of contrast to suggest active GI \r\nbleeding at this time. \r\n2. Profound hepatic steatosis.  Enlarged periportal lymph nodes \r\nwith hazy \r\nmesentery and retroperitoneum likely reflect underlying liver \r\ndisease. \r\n3.  Colonic and rectal wall thickening which may reflect colitis \r\nversus portal colopathy.\r\n4. Heterogeneous appearance of the kidneys with possible \r\nstriated nephrograms. Correlate with urinalysis to exclude \r\npyelonephritis. \r\n\r\n___ TTE:\r\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are \r\nnormal (LVEF = 65%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal \r\nleft ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right \r\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The \r\ndiameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are \r\nnormal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal \r\nwith good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic \r\nregurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. \r\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly myxomatous. Frank mitral \r\nvalve prolapse is not seen but cannot be excluded with \r\ncertainty. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate \r\n(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature \r\nof the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly \r\nunderestimated (Coanda effect). There is borderline pulmonary \r\nartery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.  \r\n\r\n\r\n___ ___\r\nIMPRESSION:   \r\n1. Occlusive thrombus of all right lower extremity deep veins \r\nfrom the common femoral vein down to the calf veins. \r\n2. Patent left lower extremity veins. \r\n\r\n___ ECHO\r\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is \r\nnormal. LV systolic function appears depressed (LVEF = 40%) \r\nsecondary to hypokinesis of the basal two-thirds of the left \r\nventricle. The apical one-third of the left ventricle is \r\nhyperdynamic. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall \r\nmotion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, \r\nascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets \r\n(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No \r\naortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are \r\nmildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic \r\npressure is normal. The pulmonary artery is not well visualized. \r\nThere is no pericardial effusion. \r\n Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \r\nleft ventricular systolic dysfunction is now present. Findings \r\nsuggestive of stress cardiomyopathy with inverse Takotsubo \r\npattern of left ventricular contractile dysfunction.  \r\n\r\n___ CTH:\r\nIMPRESSION: \r\n1. There is mild progression of global cerebral atrophy since \r\nthe prior \r\nexamination of ___, greater than would be expected \r\nfor the \r\npatient's age. \r\n2. No intracranial hemorrhage or territorial infarct. \r\n\r\n___ LIVER US:\r\nIMPRESSION:    \r\n1.  Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of \r\nliver disease including steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, or \r\ncirrhosis cannot be excluded on the basis of this examination. \r\n2.  Trace ascites and small right pleural effusion. \r\n\r\n___ IVC filter placement:\r\nFINDINGS:   \r\n1. Patent normal sized, non-duplicated IVC with  no evidence of \r\na IVC \r\nthrombus. A small circumaortic renal vein originating from the \r\nIVC just above the bifurcation was noted however is very small \r\nin caliber and likely of no clinical significance. \r\n2. Successful deployment of an infra-renal retrievable IVC \r\nfilter. \r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\nSuccessful deployment of an infra-renal removable IVC filter. \r\n\r\n___ ECHO:\r\nConclusions   \r\n The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left \r\nventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular \r\nsystolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). Right ventricular \r\nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve \r\nleaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet \r\nexcursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The \r\nmitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral \r\nregurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary \r\nartery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a \r\ntrivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. \r\n IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved \r\nregional and low normal global biventricular systolic function. \r\nNo valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified. Trivial \r\npericardial effusion. \r\n\r\n___ Unilateral RLE veins \r\nIMPRESSION:    \r\nExtensive deep venous thrombosis involving the wall of the right \r\nlower \r\nextremity veins, overall similar to ___, but now with \r\nperhaps minimal flow in the distal right SFV. \r\n\r\n___ Video oropharyngeal swallow study\r\nAspiration with thin liquid consistency.\r\n\r\n___ Portable abdomen x-ray\r\nPatient is post gastric bypass surgery.  The Dobbhoff tube ends \r\nin the \r\nproximal jejunum. \r\n\r\n___ Renal ultrasound\r\nNo evidence of hydronephrosis.  Increased renal echogenicity \r\nconsistent with diffuse parenchymal renal disease.   \r\nSmall bilateral effusions and small to moderate volume ascites. \r\n\r\n___ - EGD\r\nDuodenum was not examined. Small gastric pouch consistent with \r\nRoux en y anatomy the blind limb and jejunal limb were both \r\nvisualized. No varices. Otherwise normal EGD to the jejunum.\r\n\r\n \r\nBrief Hospital Course:\r\n___ hx gastric bypass surgery, alcohol abuse complicated by \r\nWernicke's encephalopathy, concern for autonomic insufficiency, \r\npresented originally with hypotension, anemia and academia. Her \r\ncourse in the MICU was complicated by severe nutritional \r\ndeficiency, volume overload, renal failure, cardiomyopathy, \r\nhypoxemia and hypoxemic respiratory failure, and deep vein \r\nthrombosis.\r\n\r\n# Hypotension:\r\n# Cardiomyopathy: \r\n# Presumed alcoholic liver disease:\r\nPatient was given 4u PRBCs in the ED prior to FICU admission; \r\nher Hgb was stable for days afterward, and there was low \r\nsuspicion for active GIB initially in her MICU course. She was \r\nempirically antiobiosed for concern of sepsis, but no source was \r\nfound, and these antibiotics were held until a series of \r\npresumed aspiration events that will be discussed below. Morning \r\ncortisol was within normal limits twice; TSH was also within \r\nnormal limits. She underwent several echocardiograms to explain \r\nher persistent hypotension with pressor requirement that showed \r\nin sequence: mitral regurgitation with eccentric jet; inverse \r\nTakutsubo's cardiomyopathy; and then resolution of these issues. \r\nOf note, the resolution occurred after initiation of high-dose \r\nthiamine repletion, which may suggest an element of wet \r\nberiberbi from severe nutritional deficiency in the setting of \r\ngastric bypass and alcoholism. There was also strong suspicion \r\nof cirrhosis given her imaging and alcohol abuse history, for \r\nwhich she was started on midodrine. With these measures, she was \r\nsuccessfully weaned from pressors. Unresolved at the time of her \r\nMICU discharge was a question of autonomic insufficiency raised \r\nin her last Discharge Summary of ___ where it was thought her \r\nalcohol abuse could be contributing to baseline systolic \r\npressures in the ___. This in part resolved on the floor as the \r\npatient was weaned off midodrine and maintained systolic blood \r\npressure in the 100s.\r\n\r\n# Anemia: \r\n-Unexplained, possible GI source with lack of erythropoietin in \r\nthe setting of subacute renal failure . Patient had decreasing \r\npRBC transfusion requirements over the course of her stay, \r\nultimately needing 1U pRBC every 4 days. She was evaluated by \r\nHem/Onc who felt there was no evidence of significant hemolysis \r\nor malignancy and felt that there was an element of anemia of \r\nchronic inflammation, as well as decreased erythropoietin in the \r\nsetting of subacute renal failure. She was evaluated by GI who \r\nfound no source of bleed on sigmoidoscopy early in her course \r\nand no varices or bleeding on EGD. She had an episode of guaiac \r\npositive stool but had no significant bleeding on colonoscopy. \r\nPatient may benefit from outpatient capsule study if bleeding is \r\nongoing.\r\n\r\n# Thrombocytopenia: \r\nThere was no evidence of active bleed on presentation (stool \r\nnormal color, not tachycardic, no clinical or radiographic \r\nevidence of extravasation into a compartment). Surgery and GI \r\nwere consulted early in her MICU course for concern of ischemic \r\ngut in the setting of rising lactate, but flexible sigmoidoscopy \r\nwas negative for this and lactate resolved with fluid \r\nresuscitation. ___ Hematology consulted, and believe her \r\nanemia and thrombocytopenia are likely a combination of \r\nalcoholic bone marrow suppression, malnutrition and critical \r\nillness. She may benefit from a bone marrow biopsy when more \r\nstable; additionally, given her renal failure, she may have a \r\ndeveloping EPO deficiency. She was transfused by ED prior to \r\nMICU admission and did not require further blood products until \r\n___ (gradually dropping Hct attributed to anemia of chronic \r\nillness/inflammation/underproduction; she held her Hct each time \r\nafter transfusion).  \r\n\r\n# Diarrhea:\r\nNegative c. diff, improved over the course of the hospital stay. \r\nPossibly related to tube feeding formulas as this improved with \r\nchanging to a higher fiber formula and with the addition of \r\nbanana flakes. Recommend continued loperamide as needed and \r\noptimization of tube feeds in patient s/p gastric bypass.\r\n\r\n# Renal Failure (Addressed Separately Below):\r\nPresented with serum bicarbonate of 8 of unclear etiology. She \r\nmanifested diarrhea in the early part of her ICU stay (C diff \r\nassay negative, thought related to either alcohol abuse or early \r\ncourse of antibiotics administered empirically for presumed \r\nsepsis, resolved); her renal function markers may also have been \r\nunder-estimates of her true GFR given her nutritionally \r\ndeficient state. Acidemia corrected with bicarbonate drip, but \r\nrecurrence remains in a concern in the setting of her renal \r\nfailure with poor UOP. CRRT was started in the setting of volume \r\noverload in the ICU as described above, though she was noted to \r\nhave ATN by muddy brown casts in her urine as well as \r\npersistently poor UOP. At time of FICU discharge she is being \r\ntrialed off CRRT, though with her poor UOP she may need to be \r\ninitiated on standing dialysis. Upon transfer to the floor, her \r\nrenal function did not improve and she remained oliguric. She \r\nwas evaluated by nephrology who felt that ATN without renal \r\nrecovery was the most likely diagnosis based on her urine \r\nsediment and history. A renal biopsy was considered, but \r\nnephrology felt that the risks of the biopsy on a patient \r\nalready requiring heparin for DVT would outweigh the benefits \r\nwith the suspicion of ATN being high already. Urine output \r\nremained low prior to discharge, and tunneled HD line was placed \r\nfor longer-term access.\r\n\r\n# Respiratory Failure:\r\nPatient developed progressive hypoxemia from volume overload \r\neventually requiring CRRT with resolution of the same. However, \r\non ___ she had an unexplained hypoxemic respiratory episode \r\nwith persistent SpO2 measurements in the ___ despite NRB and NC; \r\nshe was intubated with ___ of continued O2 saturations in \r\nthe ___ before resolution not attributable to any particular \r\nintervention (nebs, suction, etc). This first hypoxemic episode \r\nwas attributed to aspiration though subsequent CXR and \r\nbronchoscopy were not impressive for evidence of the same. She \r\nwas extubated within 24hrs, but then reintubated in the setting \r\nof a break in her CRRT line that caused acute hypotension from \r\nblood loss (trapped in the CRRT circuit) and then hypoxemia. \r\nAfter restoration of hemodynamic stability and passing her RSBI, \r\nshe was again extubated, but re-intubated for nearly the same \r\nexact sequence of events that evening(break in the CRRT circuit \r\ndue to equipment failure; this has been reported and is being \r\ninvestigated). She was finally extubated on ___ and remains \r\noff supplemental O2 at time of MICU discharge. Antibiotics were \r\nempirically started in the setting of possible aspiration with \r\nleukocytosis (that could have been a stress reaction to \r\naspiration pneumonitis or intubations/exbuations); these will \r\nfinish on ___. She completed her course of antibiotics and \r\nremained afebrile and without respiratory distress the rest of \r\nher hospitalization. \r\n\r\n# Alcohol Abuse:\r\nPatient endorses heavy alcohol use. She was seen by social work \r\nwho gave resources, though patient is not interested in \r\ncounseling.\r\n\r\n# Severe Nutritional Deficiency:\r\nNutritional deficiencies including zinc and selenium requiring \r\nsignificant repletion. Repeat testing of zinc showed continued \r\nneed for repletion. Caloric needs and repletion addressed below.\r\n\r\n# Severe malnutrition: likely contributor to pancytopenia \r\nresulting from bone marrow suppression. Required tube feeding \r\ntube feed which was continued at discharge in order to meet her \r\ncaloric needs. She was initially found to aspirate thin liquids \r\nby a speech and swallow evaluation, however on reevaluation \r\nafter receiving tube feeds for some time, she was able to \r\ntolerate a regular diet and thin liquids. Her caloric intake by \r\nmouth was not sufficient to decrease tube feeds.\r\n\r\n# Hx Wernicke's Encephalopathy:\r\nPatient had waxing/waning mental status for much of her early \r\nhospital course which was initially attributed to delirium; \r\nhowever, for history of Wernicke's she was started on high-dose \r\nthiamine that seemed to improve her mental status. Nutrition was \r\nconsulted, and nutrition labs were sent that were all markedly \r\nlow. She was supplemented through her TFs and will need to \r\nremain on standing thiamine.\r\n\r\n# Deep Vein Thrombosis:\r\nPatient arrived to MICU with L femoral CVL; shortly thereafter, \r\nasymmetric R > L lower extremity swelling was noticed for which \r\n___ was obtained - this showed extensive venous clot burden in \r\nthe R lower extremity. IV heparin was started. Because of \r\npersistent thrombocytopenia, an IVC filter was placed, though \r\nbecause of her high clot risk IV heparin was continued. She \r\nshould have interval follow-up of her DVTs after discharge, as \r\nwell as scheduled follow-up with ___ for filter removal. She was \r\nmaintained on a heparin drip and should be bridged to Coumadin \r\nto follow up with hematology/oncology as an outpatient.\r\n \r\n# Concern for Gastrointestinal Bleed:\r\nAs described above, GI and Surgery were consulted early in her \r\nMICU stay for rising lactate and concern of gut ischemia in the \r\nsetting of her hypotension; flexible sigmoidoscopy was \r\nunimpressive and lactate improved with pressors and IVF. Near \r\nthe end of her FICU stay she had fresh blood coating a stool \r\nwhich raised concern for GIB; however, her Hct was stable, she \r\nwas HD stable, and guaiacs of subsequent stools were negative \r\nprior to MICU discharge. She underwent evaluation by Hepatology \r\nand EGD which showed no varices, negative colonoscopy. Capsule \r\nstudy failed, but patient's H/H stabilized and hepatology felt \r\nthe study could be done as an outpatient if necessary.\r\n\r\n**Transitional:**\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n-Patient will need daily assessment for hemodialysis needs, EPO \r\nwith HD given renal failure\r\n-Reassess nutritional status and continued need for tube \r\nfeeding, potential need for G-tube\r\n-Daily electrolytes and every other day CBC to evaluate need for \r\nblood transfusion\r\n-Patient on heparin gtt for DVT.

The mediastinal and hilar contours are \r\nnormal. The \r\npulmonary vasculature is normal. Lungs are clear.  No pleural \r\neffusion or \r\npneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  \r\nChain sutures are noted in the left upper quadrant of the \r\nabdomen. \r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\nNo acute cardiopulmonary abnormality \r\n\r\n___ CT abd/pelvis:\r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\n1. No active extravasation of contrast to suggest active GI \r\nbleeding at this time. \r\n2. Profound hepatic steatosis.  Enlarged periportal lymph nodes \r\nwith hazy \r\nmesentery and retroperitoneum likely reflect underlying liver \r\ndisease. \r\n3.  Colonic and rectal wall thickening which may reflect colitis \r\nversus portal colopathy.\r\n4. Heterogeneous appearance of the kidneys with possible \r\nstriated nephrograms. Correlate with urinalysis to exclude \r\npyelonephritis. \r\n\r\n___ TTE:\r\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are \r\nnormal (LVEF = 65%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal \r\nleft ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right \r\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The \r\ndiameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are \r\nnormal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal \r\nwith good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic \r\nregurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. \r\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly myxomatous. Frank mitral \r\nvalve prolapse is not seen but cannot be excluded with \r\ncertainty. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate \r\n(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature \r\nof the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly \r\nunderestimated (Coanda effect). There is borderline pulmonary \r\nartery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.  \r\n\r\n\r\n___ ___\r\nIMPRESSION:   \r\n1. Occlusive thrombus of all right lower extremity deep veins \r\nfrom the common femoral vein down to the calf veins. \r\n2. Patent left lower extremity veins. \r\n\r\n___ ECHO\r\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is \r\nnormal. LV systolic function appears depressed (LVEF = 40%) \r\nsecondary to hypokinesis of the basal two-thirds of the left \r\nventricle. The apical one-third of the left ventricle is \r\nhyperdynamic. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall \r\nmotion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, \r\nascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets \r\n(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No \r\naortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are \r\nmildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic \r\npressure is normal. The pulmonary artery is not well visualized. \r\nThere is no pericardial effusion. \r\n Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \r\nleft ventricular systolic dysfunction is now present. Findings \r\nsuggestive of stress cardiomyopathy with inverse Takotsubo \r\npattern of left ventricular contractile dysfunction.  \r\n\r\n___ CTH:\r\nIMPRESSION: \r\n1. There is mild progression of global cerebral atrophy since \r\nthe prior \r\nexamination of ___, greater than would be expected \r\nfor the \r\npatient's age. \r\n2. No intracranial hemorrhage or territorial infarct. \r\n\r\n___ LIVER US:\r\nIMPRESSION:    \r\n1.  Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of \r\nliver disease including steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, or \r\ncirrhosis cannot be excluded on the basis of this examination. \r\n2.  Trace ascites and small right pleural effusion. \r\n\r\n___ IVC filter placement:\r\nFINDINGS:   \r\n1. Patent normal sized, non-duplicated IVC with  no evidence of \r\na IVC \r\nthrombus. A small circumaortic renal vein originating from the \r\nIVC just above the bifurcation was noted however is very small \r\nin caliber and likely of no clinical significance. \r\n2. Successful deployment of an infra-renal retrievable IVC \r\nfilter. \r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\nSuccessful deployment of an infra-renal removable IVC filter. \r\n\r\n___ ECHO:\r\nConclusions   \r\n The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left \r\nventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular \r\nsystolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). Right ventricular \r\nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve \r\nleaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet \r\nexcursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The \r\nmitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral \r\nregurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary \r\nartery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a \r\ntrivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. \r\n IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved \r\nregional and low normal global biventricular systolic function. \r\nNo valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified. Trivial \r\npericardial effusion. \r\n\r\n___ Unilateral RLE veins \r\nIMPRESSION:    \r\nExtensive deep venous thrombosis involving the wall of the right \r\nlower \r\nextremity veins, overall similar to ___, but now with \r\nperhaps minimal flow in the distal right SFV. \r\n\r\n___ Video oropharyngeal swallow study\r\nAspiration with thin liquid consistency.\r\n\r\n___ Portable abdomen x-ray\r\nPatient is post gastric bypass surgery.  The Dobbhoff tube ends \r\nin the \r\nproximal jejunum. \r\n\r\n___ Renal ultrasound\r\nNo evidence of hydronephrosis.  Increased renal echogenicity \r\nconsistent with diffuse parenchymal renal disease.   \r\nSmall bilateral effusions and small to moderate volume ascites. \r\n\r\n___ - EGD\r\nDuodenum was not examined. Small gastric pouch consistent with \r\nRoux en y anatomy the blind limb and jejunal limb were both \r\nvisualized. No varices. Otherwise normal EGD to the jejunum.\r\n\r\n \r\nBrief Hospital Course:\r\n___ hx gastric bypass surgery, alcohol abuse complicated by \r\nWernicke's encephalopathy, concern for autonomic insufficiency, \r\npresented originally with hypotension, anemia and academia. Her \r\ncourse in the MICU was complicated by severe nutritional \r\ndeficiency, volume overload, renal failure, cardiomyopathy, \r\nhypoxemia and hypoxemic respiratory failure, and deep vein \r\nthrombosis.\r\n\r\n# Hypotension:\r\n# Cardiomyopathy: \r\n# Presumed alcoholic liver disease:\r\nPatient was given 4u PRBCs in the ED prior to FICU admission; \r\nher Hgb was stable for days afterward, and there was low \r\nsuspicion for active GIB initially in her MICU course. She was \r\nempirically antiobiosed for concern of sepsis, but no source was \r\nfound, and these antibiotics were held until a series of \r\npresumed aspiration events that will be discussed below. Morning \r\ncortisol was within normal limits twice; TSH was also within \r\nnormal limits. She underwent several echocardiograms to explain \r\nher persistent hypotension with pressor requirement that showed \r\nin sequence: mitral regurgitation with eccentric jet; inverse \r\nTakutsubo's cardiomyopathy; and then resolution of these issues. \r\nOf note, the resolution occurred after initiation of high-dose \r\nthiamine repletion, which may suggest an element of wet \r\nberiberbi from severe nutritional deficiency in the setting of \r\ngastric bypass and alcoholism. There was also strong suspicion \r\nof cirrhosis given her imaging and alcohol abuse history, for \r\nwhich she was started on midodrine. With these measures, she was \r\nsuccessfully weaned from pressors. Unresolved at the time of her \r\nMICU discharge was a question of autonomic insufficiency raised \r\nin her last Discharge Summary of ___ where it was thought her \r\nalcohol abuse could be contributing to baseline systolic \r\npressures in the ___. This in part resolved on the floor as the \r\npatient was weaned off midodrine and maintained systolic blood \r\npressure in the 100s.\r\n\r\n# Anemia: \r\n-Unexplained, possible GI source with lack of erythropoietin in \r\nthe setting of subacute renal failure . Patient had decreasing \r\npRBC transfusion requirements over the course of her stay, \r\nultimately needing 1U pRBC every 4 days. She was evaluated by \r\nHem/Onc who felt there was no evidence of significant hemolysis \r\nor malignancy and felt that there was an element of anemia of \r\nchronic inflammation, as well as decreased erythropoietin in the \r\nsetting of subacute renal failure. She was evaluated by GI who \r\nfound no source of bleed on sigmoidoscopy early in her course \r\nand no varices or bleeding on EGD. She had an episode of guaiac \r\npositive stool but had no significant bleeding on colonoscopy. \r\nPatient may benefit from outpatient capsule study if bleeding is \r\nongoing.\r\n\r\n# Thrombocytopenia: \r\nThere was no evidence of active bleed on presentation (stool \r\nnormal color, not tachycardic, no clinical or radiographic \r\nevidence of extravasation into a compartment). Surgery and GI \r\nwere consulted early in her MICU course for concern of ischemic \r\ngut in the setting of rising lactate, but flexible sigmoidoscopy \r\nwas negative for this and lactate resolved with fluid \r\nresuscitation. ___ Hematology consulted, and believe her \r\nanemia and thrombocytopenia are likely a combination of \r\nalcoholic bone marrow suppression, malnutrition and critical \r\nillness. She may benefit from a bone marrow biopsy when more \r\nstable; additionally, given her renal failure, she may have a \r\ndeveloping EPO deficiency. She was transfused by ED prior to \r\nMICU admission and did not require further blood products until \r\n___ (gradually dropping Hct attributed to anemia of chronic \r\nillness/inflammation/underproduction; she held her Hct each time \r\nafter transfusion).  \r\n\r\n# Diarrhea:\r\nNegative c. diff, improved over the course of the hospital stay. \r\nPossibly related to tube feeding formulas as this improved with \r\nchanging to a higher fiber formula and with the addition of \r\nbanana flakes. Recommend continued loperamide as needed and \r\noptimization of tube feeds in patient s/p gastric bypass.\r\n\r\n# Renal Failure (Addressed Separately Below):\r\nPresented with serum bicarbonate of 8 of unclear etiology. She \r\nmanifested diarrhea in the early part of her ICU stay (C diff \r\nassay negative, thought related to either alcohol abuse or early \r\ncourse of antibiotics administered empirically for presumed \r\nsepsis, resolved); her renal function markers may also have been \r\nunder-estimates of her true GFR given her nutritionally \r\ndeficient state. Acidemia corrected with bicarbonate drip, but \r\nrecurrence remains in a concern in the setting of her renal \r\nfailure with poor UOP. CRRT was started in the setting of volume \r\noverload in the ICU as described above, though she was noted to \r\nhave ATN by muddy brown casts in her urine as well as \r\npersistently poor UOP. At time of FICU discharge she is being \r\ntrialed off CRRT, though with her poor UOP she may need to be \r\ninitiated on standing dialysis. Upon transfer to the floor, her \r\nrenal function did not improve and she remained oliguric. She \r\nwas evaluated by nephrology who felt that ATN without renal \r\nrecovery was the most likely diagnosis based on her urine \r\nsediment and history. A renal biopsy was considered, but \r\nnephrology felt that the risks of the biopsy on a patient \r\nalready requiring heparin for DVT would outweigh the benefits \r\nwith the suspicion of ATN being high already. Urine output \r\nremained low prior to discharge, and tunneled HD line was placed \r\nfor longer-term access.\r\n\r\n# Respiratory Failure:\r\nPatient developed progressive hypoxemia from volume overload \r\neventually requiring CRRT with resolution of the same. However, \r\non ___ she had an unexplained hypoxemic respiratory episode \r\nwith persistent SpO2 measurements in the ___ despite NRB and NC; \r\nshe was intubated with ___ of continued O2 saturations in \r\nthe ___ before resolution not attributable to any particular \r\nintervention (nebs, suction, etc). This first hypoxemic episode \r\nwas attributed to aspiration though subsequent CXR and \r\nbronchoscopy were not impressive for evidence of the same. She \r\nwas extubated within 24hrs, but then reintubated in the setting \r\nof a break in her CRRT line that caused acute hypotension from \r\nblood loss (trapped in the CRRT circuit) and then hypoxemia. \r\nAfter restoration of hemodynamic stability and passing her RSBI, \r\nshe was again extubated, but re-intubated for nearly the same \r\nexact sequence of events that evening(break in the CRRT circuit \r\ndue to equipment failure; this has been reported and is being \r\ninvestigated). She was finally extubated on ___ and remains \r\noff supplemental O2 at time of MICU discharge. Antibiotics were \r\nempirically started in the setting of possible aspiration with \r\nleukocytosis (that could have been a stress reaction to \r\naspiration pneumonitis or intubations/exbuations); these will \r\nfinish on ___. She completed her course of antibiotics and \r\nremained afebrile and without respiratory distress the rest of \r\nher hospitalization. \r\n\r\n# Alcohol Abuse:\r\nPatient endorses heavy alcohol use. She was seen by social work \r\nwho gave resources, though patient is not interested in \r\ncounseling.\r\n\r\n# Severe Nutritional Deficiency:\r\nNutritional deficiencies including zinc and selenium requiring \r\nsignificant repletion. Repeat testing of zinc showed continued \r\nneed for repletion. Caloric needs and repletion addressed below.\r\n\r\n# Severe malnutrition: likely contributor to pancytopenia \r\nresulting from bone marrow suppression. Required tube feeding \r\ntube feed which was continued at discharge in order to meet her \r\ncaloric needs. She was initially found to aspirate thin liquids \r\nby a speech and swallow evaluation, however on reevaluation \r\nafter receiving tube feeds for some time, she was able to \r\ntolerate a regular diet and thin liquids. Her caloric intake by \r\nmouth was not sufficient to decrease tube feeds.\r\n\r\n# Hx Wernicke's Encephalopathy:\r\nPatient had waxing/waning mental status for much of her early \r\nhospital course which was initially attributed to delirium; \r\nhowever, for history of Wernicke's she was started on high-dose \r\nthiamine that seemed to improve her mental status. Nutrition was \r\nconsulted, and nutrition labs were sent that were all markedly \r\nlow. She was supplemented through her TFs and will need to \r\nremain on standing thiamine.\r\n\r\n# Deep Vein Thrombosis:\r\nPatient arrived to MICU with L femoral CVL; shortly thereafter, \r\nasymmetric R > L lower extremity swelling was noticed for which \r\n___ was obtained - this showed extensive venous clot burden in \r\nthe R lower extremity. IV heparin was started. Because of \r\npersistent thrombocytopenia, an IVC filter was placed, though \r\nbecause of her high clot risk IV heparin was continued. She \r\nshould have interval follow-up of her DVTs after discharge, as \r\nwell as scheduled follow-up with ___ for filter removal. She was \r\nmaintained on a heparin drip and should be bridged to Coumadin \r\nto follow up with hematology/oncology as an outpatient.\r\n \r\n# Concern for Gastrointestinal Bleed:\r\nAs described above, GI and Surgery were consulted early in her \r\nMICU stay for rising lactate and concern of gut ischemia in the \r\nsetting of her hypotension; flexible sigmoidoscopy was \r\nunimpressive and lactate improved with pressors and IVF. Near \r\nthe end of her FICU stay she had fresh blood coating a stool \r\nwhich raised concern for GIB; however, her Hct was stable, she \r\nwas HD stable, and guaiacs of subsequent stools were negative \r\nprior to MICU discharge. She underwent evaluation by Hepatology \r\nand EGD which showed no varices, negative colonoscopy. Capsule \r\nstudy failed, but patient's H/H stabilized and hepatology felt \r\nthe study could be done as an outpatient if necessary.\r\n\r\n**Transitional:**\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n-Patient will need daily assessment for hemodialysis needs, EPO \r\nwith HD given renal failure\r\n-Reassess nutritional status and continued need for tube \r\nfeeding, potential need for G-tube\r\n-Daily electrolytes and every other day CBC to evaluate need for \r\nblood transfusion\r\n-Patient on heparin gtt for DVT.

The mediastinal and hilar contours are \r\nnormal. The \r\npulmonary vasculature is normal. Lungs are clear.  No pleural \r\neffusion or \r\npneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  \r\nChain sutures are noted in the left upper quadrant of the \r\nabdomen. \r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\nNo acute cardiopulmonary abnormality \r\n\r\n___ CT abd/pelvis:\r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\n1. No active extravasation of contrast to suggest active GI \r\nbleeding at this time. \r\n2. Profound hepatic steatosis.  Enlarged periportal lymph nodes \r\nwith hazy \r\nmesentery and retroperitoneum likely reflect underlying liver \r\ndisease. \r\n3.  Colonic and rectal wall thickening which may reflect colitis \r\nversus portal colopathy.\r\n4. Heterogeneous appearance of the kidneys with possible \r\nstriated nephrograms. Correlate with urinalysis to exclude \r\npyelonephritis. \r\n\r\n___ TTE:\r\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are \r\nnormal (LVEF = 65%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal \r\nleft ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right \r\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The \r\ndiameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are \r\nnormal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal \r\nwith good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic \r\nregurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. \r\nThe mitral valve leaflets are mildly myxomatous. Frank mitral \r\nvalve prolapse is not seen but cannot be excluded with \r\ncertainty. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate \r\n(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature \r\nof the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly \r\nunderestimated (Coanda effect). There is borderline pulmonary \r\nartery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.  \r\n\r\n\r\n___ ___\r\nIMPRESSION:   \r\n1. Occlusive thrombus of all right lower extremity deep veins \r\nfrom the common femoral vein down to the calf veins. \r\n2. Patent left lower extremity veins. \r\n\r\n___ ECHO\r\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is \r\nnormal. LV systolic function appears depressed (LVEF = 40%) \r\nsecondary to hypokinesis of the basal two-thirds of the left \r\nventricle. The apical one-third of the left ventricle is \r\nhyperdynamic. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall \r\nmotion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, \r\nascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets \r\n(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No \r\naortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are \r\nmildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic \r\npressure is normal. The pulmonary artery is not well visualized. \r\nThere is no pericardial effusion. \r\n Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \r\nleft ventricular systolic dysfunction is now present. Findings \r\nsuggestive of stress cardiomyopathy with inverse Takotsubo \r\npattern of left ventricular contractile dysfunction.  \r\n\r\n___ CTH:\r\nIMPRESSION: \r\n1. There is mild progression of global cerebral atrophy since \r\nthe prior \r\nexamination of ___, greater than would be expected \r\nfor the \r\npatient's age. \r\n2. No intracranial hemorrhage or territorial infarct. \r\n\r\n___ LIVER US:\r\nIMPRESSION:    \r\n1.  Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of \r\nliver disease including steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, or \r\ncirrhosis cannot be excluded on the basis of this examination. \r\n2.  Trace ascites and small right pleural effusion. \r\n\r\n___ IVC filter placement:\r\nFINDINGS:   \r\n1. Patent normal sized, non-duplicated IVC with  no evidence of \r\na IVC \r\nthrombus. A small circumaortic renal vein originating from the \r\nIVC just above the bifurcation was noted however is very small \r\nin caliber and likely of no clinical significance. \r\n2. Successful deployment of an infra-renal retrievable IVC \r\nfilter. \r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\nSuccessful deployment of an infra-renal removable IVC filter. \r\n\r\n___ ECHO:\r\nConclusions   \r\n The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall \r\nthicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left \r\nventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular \r\nsystolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). Right ventricular \r\nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve \r\nleaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet \r\nexcursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The \r\nmitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral \r\nregurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary \r\nartery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a \r\ntrivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. \r\n IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved \r\nregional and low normal global biventricular systolic function. \r\nNo valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified. Trivial \r\npericardial effusion. \r\n\r\n___ Unilateral RLE veins \r\nIMPRESSION:    \r\nExtensive deep venous thrombosis involving the wall of the right \r\nlower \r\nextremity veins, overall similar to ___, but now with \r\nperhaps minimal flow in the distal right SFV. \r\n\r\n___ Video oropharyngeal swallow study\r\nAspiration with thin liquid consistency.\r\n\r\n___ Portable abdomen x-ray\r\nPatient is post gastric bypass surgery.  The Dobbhoff tube ends \r\nin the \r\nproximal jejunum. \r\n\r\n___ Renal ultrasound\r\nNo evidence of hydronephrosis.  Increased renal echogenicity \r\nconsistent with diffuse parenchymal renal disease.   \r\nSmall bilateral effusions and small to moderate volume ascites. \r\n\r\n___ - EGD\r\nDuodenum was not examined. Small gastric pouch consistent with \r\nRoux en y anatomy the blind limb and jejunal limb were both \r\nvisualized. No varices. Otherwise normal EGD to the jejunum.\r\n\r\n \r\nBrief Hospital Course:\r\n___ hx gastric bypass surgery, alcohol abuse complicated by \r\nWernicke's encephalopathy, concern for autonomic insufficiency, \r\npresented originally with hypotension, anemia and academia. Her \r\ncourse in the MICU was complicated by severe nutritional \r\ndeficiency, volume overload, renal failure, cardiomyopathy, \r\nhypoxemia and hypoxemic respiratory failure, and deep vein \r\nthrombosis.\r\n\r\n# Hypotension:\r\n# Cardiomyopathy: \r\n# Presumed alcoholic liver disease:\r\nPatient was given 4u PRBCs in the ED prior to FICU admission; \r\nher Hgb was stable for days afterward, and there was low \r\nsuspicion for active GIB initially in her MICU course. She was \r\nempirically antiobiosed for concern of sepsis, but no source was \r\nfound, and these antibiotics were held until a series of \r\npresumed aspiration events that will be discussed below. Morning \r\ncortisol was within normal limits twice; TSH was also within \r\nnormal limits. She underwent several echocardiograms to explain \r\nher persistent hypotension with pressor requirement that showed \r\nin sequence: mitral regurgitation with eccentric jet; inverse \r\nTakutsubo's cardiomyopathy; and then resolution of these issues. \r\nOf note, the resolution occurred after initiation of high-dose \r\nthiamine repletion, which may suggest an element of wet \r\nberiberbi from severe nutritional deficiency in the setting of \r\ngastric bypass and alcoholism. There was also strong suspicion \r\nof cirrhosis given her imaging and alcohol abuse history, for \r\nwhich she was started on midodrine. With these measures, she was \r\nsuccessfully weaned from pressors. Unresolved at the time of her \r\nMICU discharge was a question of autonomic insufficiency raised \r\nin her last Discharge Summary of ___ where it was thought her \r\nalcohol abuse could be contributing to baseline systolic \r\npressures in the ___. This in part resolved on the floor as the \r\npatient was weaned off midodrine and maintained systolic blood \r\npressure in the 100s.\r\n\r\n# Anemia: \r\n-Unexplained, possible GI source with lack of erythropoietin in \r\nthe setting of subacute renal failure . Patient had decreasing \r\npRBC transfusion requirements over the course of her stay, \r\nultimately needing 1U pRBC every 4 days. She was evaluated by \r\nHem/Onc who felt there was no evidence of significant hemolysis \r\nor malignancy and felt that there was an element of anemia of \r\nchronic inflammation, as well as decreased erythropoietin in the \r\nsetting of subacute renal failure. She was evaluated by GI who \r\nfound no source of bleed on sigmoidoscopy early in her course \r\nand no varices or bleeding on EGD. She had an episode of guaiac \r\npositive stool but had no significant bleeding on colonoscopy. \r\nPatient may benefit from outpatient capsule study if bleeding is \r\nongoing.\r\n\r\n# Thrombocytopenia: \r\nThere was no evidence of active bleed on presentation (stool \r\nnormal color, not tachycardic, no clinical or radiographic \r\nevidence of extravasation into a compartment). Surgery and GI \r\nwere consulted early in her MICU course for concern of ischemic \r\ngut in the setting of rising lactate, but flexible sigmoidoscopy \r\nwas negative for this and lactate resolved with fluid \r\nresuscitation. ___ Hematology consulted, and believe her \r\nanemia and thrombocytopenia are likely a combination of \r\nalcoholic bone marrow suppression, malnutrition and critical \r\nillness. She may benefit from a bone marrow biopsy when more \r\nstable; additionally, given her renal failure, she may have a \r\ndeveloping EPO deficiency. She was transfused by ED prior to \r\nMICU admission and did not require further blood products until \r\n___ (gradually dropping Hct attributed to anemia of chronic \r\nillness/inflammation/underproduction; she held her Hct each time \r\nafter transfusion).  \r\n\r\n# Diarrhea:\r\nNegative c. diff, improved over the course of the hospital stay. \r\nPossibly related to tube feeding formulas as this improved with \r\nchanging to a higher fiber formula and with the addition of \r\nbanana flakes. Recommend continued loperamide as needed and \r\noptimization of tube feeds in patient s/p gastric bypass.\r\n\r\n# Renal Failure (Addressed Separately Below):\r\nPresented with serum bicarbonate of 8 of unclear etiology. She \r\nmanifested diarrhea in the early part of her ICU stay (C diff \r\nassay negative, thought related to either alcohol abuse or early \r\ncourse of antibiotics administered empirically for presumed \r\nsepsis, resolved); her renal function markers may also have been \r\nunder-estimates of her true GFR given her nutritionally \r\ndeficient state. Acidemia corrected with bicarbonate drip, but \r\nrecurrence remains in a concern in the setting of her renal \r\nfailure with poor UOP. CRRT was started in the setting of volume \r\noverload in the ICU as described above, though she was noted to \r\nhave ATN by muddy brown casts in her urine as well as \r\npersistently poor UOP. At time of FICU discharge she is being \r\ntrialed off CRRT, though with her poor UOP she may need to be \r\ninitiated on standing dialysis. Upon transfer to the floor, her \r\nrenal function did not improve and she remained oliguric. She \r\nwas evaluated by nephrology who felt that ATN without renal \r\nrecovery was the most likely diagnosis based on her urine \r\nsediment and history. A renal biopsy was considered, but \r\nnephrology felt that the risks of the biopsy on a patient \r\nalready requiring heparin for DVT would outweigh the benefits \r\nwith the suspicion of ATN being high already. Urine output \r\nremained low prior to discharge, and tunneled HD line was placed \r\nfor longer-term access.\r\n\r\n# Respiratory Failure:\r\nPatient developed progressive hypoxemia from volume overload \r\neventually requiring CRRT with resolution of the same. However, \r\non ___ she had an unexplained hypoxemic respiratory episode \r\nwith persistent SpO2 measurements in the ___ despite NRB and NC; \r\nshe was intubated with ___ of continued O2 saturations in \r\nthe ___ before resolution not attributable to any particular \r\nintervention (nebs, suction, etc). This first hypoxemic episode \r\nwas attributed to aspiration though subsequent CXR and \r\nbronchoscopy were not impressive for evidence of the same. She \r\nwas extubated within 24hrs, but then reintubated in the setting \r\nof a break in her CRRT line that caused acute hypotension from \r\nblood loss (trapped in the CRRT circuit) and then hypoxemia. \r\nAfter restoration of hemodynamic stability and passing her RSBI, \r\nshe was again extubated, but re-intubated for nearly the same \r\nexact sequence of events that evening(break in the CRRT circuit \r\ndue to equipment failure; this has been reported and is being \r\ninvestigated). She was finally extubated on ___ and remains \r\noff supplemental O2 at time of MICU discharge. Antibiotics were \r\nempirically started in the setting of possible aspiration with \r\nleukocytosis (that could have been a stress reaction to \r\naspiration pneumonitis or intubations/exbuations); these will \r\nfinish on ___. She completed her course of antibiotics and \r\nremained afebrile and without respiratory distress the rest of \r\nher hospitalization. \r\n\r\n# Alcohol Abuse:\r\nPatient endorses heavy alcohol use. She was seen by social work \r\nwho gave resources, though patient is not interested in \r\ncounseling.\r\n\r\n# Severe Nutritional Deficiency:\r\nNutritional deficiencies including zinc and selenium requiring \r\nsignificant repletion. Repeat testing of zinc showed continued \r\nneed for repletion. Caloric needs and repletion addressed below.\r\n\r\n# Severe malnutrition: likely contributor to pancytopenia \r\nresulting from bone marrow suppression. Required tube feeding \r\ntube feed which was continued at discharge in order to meet her \r\ncaloric needs. She was initially found to aspirate thin liquids \r\nby a speech and swallow evaluation, however on reevaluation \r\nafter receiving tube feeds for some time, she was able to \r\ntolerate a regular diet and thin liquids. Her caloric intake by \r\nmouth was not sufficient to decrease tube feeds.\r\n\r\n# Hx Wernicke's Encephalopathy:\r\nPatient had waxing/waning mental status for much of her early \r\nhospital course which was initially attributed to delirium; \r\nhowever, for history of Wernicke's she was started on high-dose \r\nthiamine that seemed to improve her mental status. Nutrition was \r\nconsulted, and nutrition labs were sent that were all markedly \r\nlow. She was supplemented through her TFs and will need to \r\nremain on standing thiamine.\r\n\r\n# Deep Vein Thrombosis:\r\nPatient arrived to MICU with L femoral CVL; shortly thereafter, \r\nasymmetric R > L lower extremity swelling was noticed for which \r\n___ was obtained - this showed extensive venous clot burden in \r\nthe R lower extremity. IV heparin was started. Because of \r\npersistent thrombocytopenia, an IVC filter was placed, though \r\nbecause of her high clot risk IV heparin was continued. She \r\nshould have interval follow-up of her DVTs after discharge, as \r\nwell as scheduled follow-up with ___ for filter removal. She was \r\nmaintained on a heparin drip and should be bridged to Coumadin \r\nto follow up with hematology/oncology as an outpatient.\r\n \r\n# Concern for Gastrointestinal Bleed:\r\nAs described above, GI and Surgery were consulted early in her \r\nMICU stay for rising lactate and concern of gut ischemia in the \r\nsetting of her hypotension; flexible sigmoidoscopy was \r\nunimpressive and lactate improved with pressors and IVF. Near \r\nthe end of her FICU stay she had fresh blood coating a stool \r\nwhich raised concern for GIB; however, her Hct was stable, she \r\nwas HD stable, and guaiacs of subsequent stools were negative \r\nprior to MICU discharge. She underwent evaluation by Hepatology \r\nand EGD which showed no varices, negative colonoscopy. Capsule \r\nstudy failed, but patient's H/H stabilized and hepatology felt \r\nthe study could be done as an outpatient if necessary.\r\n\r\n**Transitional:**\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n-Patient will need daily assessment for hemodialysis needs, EPO \r\nwith HD given renal failure\r\n-Reassess nutritional status and continued need for tube \r\nfeeding, potential need for G-tube\r\n-Daily electrolytes and every other day CBC to evaluate need for \r\nblood transfusion\r\n-Patient on heparin gtt for DVT.

Significant improvement in hepatic steatosis. \r\n\r\nCT CHEST W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___  \r\nNormal Chest CT. No evidence of active intrathoracic infection \r\nor malignancy.  Right lower lobe opacity described on recent CT \r\nhas almost completely resolved consistent with resolving \r\natelectasis \r\n \r\nBrief Hospital Course:\r\nMs. ___ is a ___ w/ PMH of EtOH abuse (currently still \r\ndrinking) c/b EtOH hepatitis, Wernicke's encephalopathy, \r\nhypotension likely due to autonomic neuropathy; hypothyroidism, \r\nhypertension, Hx of bariatric surgery, and other issues who was \r\nsent to the ED with hypotension and bandemia concerning for \r\npancreatitis.\r\n\r\n#Septic shock: Patient presented with abdominal pain and fever, \r\nwas found to have hypotension requiring IVF resuscitation and \r\nlevophed for which she had a R IJ CVL placed. She was \r\nsubsequently found to have GNR bacteremia which speciated to pan \r\nsensitive klebsiella in ___ bottles. She was initialy treated \r\nwith broad spectrum antibiotics with IV Vancomycin/Zosyn which \r\nwas narrowed to PO Ciprolfoxacin on discharge. Her blood \r\npressure gradually increased and patient was off levophed with \r\noverall improvement of her symptoms. The etiology of the \r\nbacteremia as thought likely to be intrabdominal given pain and \r\nfurther findings described below in # abdominal pain. The \r\ndifferential also included pelvic process given adnexal \r\ntenderness on physical exam. Urinary etiologies were on the \r\ndifferential, though no urine culture prior to antibiosis \r\nobtained. The patient had previous hematoma evacuation of right \r\nthigh though wound appeared intact without evidence of \r\ninfection. Of note the patient had a history of high risk HPV \r\nwith ASCUS and there was concern that cervical etiologies could \r\nbe the source of infection, particularly concerning for \r\nmalignancy in the setting of her anemia and recent thrombosis as \r\nwell. The patient understood the need for outpatient follow up \r\nwith pap smear and IUD removal, and this was relayed to the \r\npatient's PCP as well. There were no other appreciate sources of \r\ninfection on non contrast (in setting ___ on CKD) scans of \r\nthe chest, abdomen and pelvis. The patient remained afebrile and \r\nhemodynamically stable after transfer to the medicine floor from \r\nthe MICU.\r\n\r\n# Abdominal pain: Patient presented with abdominal pain and \r\nfever, was found to have GNR bacteremia speciated to pan \r\nsensitive klebsiella as above. In terms of source of infection, \r\nRUQ ultrasound was without evidence of cholecystitis or CBD \r\ndilatation and CT chest/abdomen was not notable for any \r\nabnormalities that could explain the symptoms. Elevated lipase \r\nwith elevated LFTs was suggestive of pancreatitis; however, her \r\npain was not entirely typical (not prominent in epigastrium) and \r\nCT abdomen did not show signs of pancrteatitis. \r\nCholedocholithiasis with a passed stone was thought to be a \r\npossibility as well given the downtrending LFTS. The \r\ndifferential also included pelvic etiology, though patient \r\ndenied any urinary or vaginal symptoms. The patient's pain \r\nimproved thoughout the admission and the patient was tolerating \r\nPO well on discharge.  \r\n\r\n# Pancreatitis: Patient with lipase >3X ULN and abdominal pain \r\n(though somewhat atypical), however no evidence of pancreatitis \r\non CT (though non contrast given ___ on CKD). Differential \r\nincluded EtOH given history of heavy drinking, biliary sources \r\ngiven elevated LFTs on admission as well. However lipase may \r\nalso have been elevated for alternate etiologies in the setting \r\nof possible GI infection and may not have been representative of \r\ntrue pancreatitis. As above the patient's pain improved \r\nthroughout the admission and was tolerating PO well on \r\ndischarge. \r\n\r\n# Transaminitis: The differential included biliary infection, \r\nhowever  RUQ US without cholecystitis or biliary dilatation, vs. \r\ncholedochlithiasis with passed stone. Could consider \r\ncontribution from heavy EtOH as well, though ration of ALT/AST \r\nless suggestive of this etiology. The patient's LFTs improved \r\nthroughout the hospital course, and T bili normalized. \r\n\r\n# ___: Patient was recently discontinued from \r\nhemodialysis in the past month, as her renal function has \r\nrecovered from a prior ATN. Cr was elevated on admission to 3.3. \r\nShe received fluid and her creatinine gradually decreased. \r\nCreatinine on discharge was 1.8.\r\n\r\n# Anemia: Patient with chronic anemia extensively worked up in \r\nthe past. No evidence of current hemolysis given normalized T \r\nbili. Likely component of hemoconcentration on admission in the \r\nsetting of septic shock. Differential included infection and \r\nmedication (Zosyn) causing bone marrow suppression, as well as \r\nheavy EtOh use. The patient did not require any blood \r\ntransfusions during the admission.\r\n\r\n# EtOH abuse: Patient reported drinking ___ to 1 pint of hard \r\nliquor per day, with her last drink being the day before \r\nadmission. She was placed on CIWA scale, and treated with \r\nmultivitamins and thiamine. The patient attempted to leave AMA \r\nthe day prior to discharge and was evaluated by psychiatry \r\novernight who were concerned that the patient lacked capacity to \r\nat that time. The patient as re evaluated in the morning by \r\npsychiatry and after further discussion was deemed to have \r\ncapacity regarding her plan of care. The patient was instructed \r\nregarding risks of alcohol withdrawal and referred to substance \r\nabuse treatment by psychiatry which she declined.\r\n\r\n# ___ metabolic acidosis: Resolved. Most likely due to \r\nlactic acidosis on presentation\r\n\r\n# Equivocal Serum HCG: Patient denied possibility of pregnancy. \r\nUrine hCG was negative. Patient with IUD in place with plans for \r\noutpatient removal.\r\n\r\n====================\r\nCHRONIC ISSUES\r\n====================\r\n# Hypothyroidism: Patient continued Levothyroxine Sodium 62.5 \r\nmcg PO DAILY. \r\n\r\n# Hx of wet beri beri: Furosemide was held in the setting of \r\nseptic shock and held on discharge given no evidence of volume \r\noverload and soft pressures.\r\n\r\n# HTN: Home Hydrochlorothiazide held as well given infection and \r\nsoft pressures as well. \r\n\r\n# Gout: Patient restarted on home allopurinol. \r\n\r\n====================\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\r\n==================== \r\n- Please continue PO Ciprofloxacin through ___ (___)\r\n- Patient will need pap smear as outpatient for further \r\nevaluation of high risk HPV in setting of bacteremia, anemia, \r\nand thrombosis\r\n- Please discuss with PCP the need for restarting furosemide as \r\nan outpatient.\r\n- Patient will need removal of IUD\r\n- Patient will need removal of IVC filter in future - please \r\ndiscuss with PCP\r\n- ___ obtain CBC and Chem 10 at next PCP appointment for \r\nevaluation of anemia and Creatinine given ___ on CKD\r\n \r\nMedications on Admission:\r\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\r\n1.

Right lower lobe opacity described on recent CT \r\nhas almost completely resolved consistent with resolving \r\natelectasis \r\n \r\nBrief Hospital Course:\r\nMs. ___ is a ___ w/ PMH of EtOH abuse (currently still \r\ndrinking) c/b EtOH hepatitis, Wernicke's encephalopathy, \r\nhypotension likely due to autonomic neuropathy; hypothyroidism, \r\nhypertension, Hx of bariatric surgery, and other issues who was \r\nsent to the ED with hypotension and bandemia concerning for \r\npancreatitis.\r\n\r\n#Septic shock: Patient presented with abdominal pain and fever, \r\nwas found to have hypotension requiring IVF resuscitation and \r\nlevophed for which she had a R IJ CVL placed. She was \r\nsubsequently found to have GNR bacteremia which speciated to pan \r\nsensitive klebsiella in ___ bottles. She was initialy treated \r\nwith broad spectrum antibiotics with IV Vancomycin/Zosyn which \r\nwas narrowed to PO Ciprolfoxacin on discharge. Her blood \r\npressure gradually increased and patient was off levophed with \r\noverall improvement of her symptoms. The etiology of the \r\nbacteremia as thought likely to be intrabdominal given pain and \r\nfurther findings described below in # abdominal pain. The \r\ndifferential also included pelvic process given adnexal \r\ntenderness on physical exam. Urinary etiologies were on the \r\ndifferential, though no urine culture prior to antibiosis \r\nobtained. The patient had previous hematoma evacuation of right \r\nthigh though wound appeared intact without evidence of \r\ninfection. Of note the patient had a history of high risk HPV \r\nwith ASCUS and there was concern that cervical etiologies could \r\nbe the source of infection, particularly concerning for \r\nmalignancy in the setting of her anemia and recent thrombosis as \r\nwell. The patient understood the need for outpatient follow up \r\nwith pap smear and IUD removal, and this was relayed to the \r\npatient's PCP as well. There were no other appreciate sources of \r\ninfection on non contrast (in setting ___ on CKD) scans of \r\nthe chest, abdomen and pelvis. The patient remained afebrile and \r\nhemodynamically stable after transfer to the medicine floor from \r\nthe MICU.\r\n\r\n# Abdominal pain: Patient presented with abdominal pain and \r\nfever, was found to have GNR bacteremia speciated to pan \r\nsensitive klebsiella as above. In terms of source of infection, \r\nRUQ ultrasound was without evidence of cholecystitis or CBD \r\ndilatation and CT chest/abdomen was not notable for any \r\nabnormalities that could explain the symptoms. Elevated lipase \r\nwith elevated LFTs was suggestive of pancreatitis; however, her \r\npain was not entirely typical (not prominent in epigastrium) and \r\nCT abdomen did not show signs of pancrteatitis. \r\nCholedocholithiasis with a passed stone was thought to be a \r\npossibility as well given the downtrending LFTS. The \r\ndifferential also included pelvic etiology, though patient \r\ndenied any urinary or vaginal symptoms. The patient's pain \r\nimproved thoughout the admission and the patient was tolerating \r\nPO well on discharge.  \r\n\r\n# Pancreatitis: Patient with lipase >3X ULN and abdominal pain \r\n(though somewhat atypical), however no evidence of pancreatitis \r\non CT (though non contrast given ___ on CKD). Differential \r\nincluded EtOH given history of heavy drinking, biliary sources \r\ngiven elevated LFTs on admission as well. However lipase may \r\nalso have been elevated for alternate etiologies in the setting \r\nof possible GI infection and may not have been representative of \r\ntrue pancreatitis. As above the patient's pain improved \r\nthroughout the admission and was tolerating PO well on \r\ndischarge. \r\n\r\n# Transaminitis: The differential included biliary infection, \r\nhowever  RUQ US without cholecystitis or biliary dilatation, vs. \r\ncholedochlithiasis with passed stone. Could consider \r\ncontribution from heavy EtOH as well, though ration of ALT/AST \r\nless suggestive of this etiology. The patient's LFTs improved \r\nthroughout the hospital course, and T bili normalized. \r\n\r\n# ___: Patient was recently discontinued from \r\nhemodialysis in the past month, as her renal function has \r\nrecovered from a prior ATN. Cr was elevated on admission to 3.3. \r\nShe received fluid and her creatinine gradually decreased. \r\nCreatinine on discharge was 1.8.\r\n\r\n# Anemia: Patient with chronic anemia extensively worked up in \r\nthe past. No evidence of current hemolysis given normalized T \r\nbili. Likely component of hemoconcentration on admission in the \r\nsetting of septic shock. Differential included infection and \r\nmedication (Zosyn) causing bone marrow suppression, as well as \r\nheavy EtOh use. The patient did not require any blood \r\ntransfusions during the admission.\r\n\r\n# EtOH abuse: Patient reported drinking ___ to 1 pint of hard \r\nliquor per day, with her last drink being the day before \r\nadmission. She was placed on CIWA scale, and treated with \r\nmultivitamins and thiamine. The patient attempted to leave AMA \r\nthe day prior to discharge and was evaluated by psychiatry \r\novernight who were concerned that the patient lacked capacity to \r\nat that time. The patient as re evaluated in the morning by \r\npsychiatry and after further discussion was deemed to have \r\ncapacity regarding her plan of care. The patient was instructed \r\nregarding risks of alcohol withdrawal and referred to substance \r\nabuse treatment by psychiatry which she declined.\r\n\r\n# ___ metabolic acidosis: Resolved. Most likely due to \r\nlactic acidosis on presentation\r\n\r\n# Equivocal Serum HCG: Patient denied possibility of pregnancy. \r\nUrine hCG was negative. Patient with IUD in place with plans for \r\noutpatient removal.\r\n\r\n====================\r\nCHRONIC ISSUES\r\n====================\r\n# Hypothyroidism: Patient continued Levothyroxine Sodium 62.5 \r\nmcg PO DAILY. \r\n\r\n# Hx of wet beri beri: Furosemide was held in the setting of \r\nseptic shock and held on discharge given no evidence of volume \r\noverload and soft pressures.\r\n\r\n# HTN: Home Hydrochlorothiazide held as well given infection and \r\nsoft pressures as well. \r\n\r\n# Gout: Patient restarted on home allopurinol. \r\n\r\n====================\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\r\n==================== \r\n- Please continue PO Ciprofloxacin through ___ (___)\r\n- Patient will need pap smear as outpatient for further \r\nevaluation of high risk HPV in setting of bacteremia, anemia, \r\nand thrombosis\r\n- Please discuss with PCP the need for restarting furosemide as \r\nan outpatient.\r\n- Patient will need removal of IUD\r\n- Patient will need removal of IVC filter in future - please \r\ndiscuss with PCP\r\n- ___ obtain CBC and Chem 10 at next PCP appointment for \r\nevaluation of anemia and Creatinine given ___ on CKD\r\n \r\nMedications on Admission:\r\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\r\n1.

Right lower lobe opacity described on recent CT \r\nhas almost completely resolved consistent with resolving \r\natelectasis \r\n \r\nBrief Hospital Course:\r\nMs. ___ is a ___ w/ PMH of EtOH abuse (currently still \r\ndrinking) c/b EtOH hepatitis, Wernicke's encephalopathy, \r\nhypotension likely due to autonomic neuropathy; hypothyroidism, \r\nhypertension, Hx of bariatric surgery, and other issues who was \r\nsent to the ED with hypotension and bandemia concerning for \r\npancreatitis.\r\n\r\n#Septic shock: Patient presented with abdominal pain and fever, \r\nwas found to have hypotension requiring IVF resuscitation and \r\nlevophed for which she had a R IJ CVL placed. She was \r\nsubsequently found to have GNR bacteremia which speciated to pan \r\nsensitive klebsiella in ___ bottles. She was initialy treated \r\nwith broad spectrum antibiotics with IV Vancomycin/Zosyn which \r\nwas narrowed to PO Ciprolfoxacin on discharge. Her blood \r\npressure gradually increased and patient was off levophed with \r\noverall improvement of her symptoms. The etiology of the \r\nbacteremia as thought likely to be intrabdominal given pain and \r\nfurther findings described below in # abdominal pain. The \r\ndifferential also included pelvic process given adnexal \r\ntenderness on physical exam. Urinary etiologies were on the \r\ndifferential, though no urine culture prior to antibiosis \r\nobtained. The patient had previous hematoma evacuation of right \r\nthigh though wound appeared intact without evidence of \r\ninfection. Of note the patient had a history of high risk HPV \r\nwith ASCUS and there was concern that cervical etiologies could \r\nbe the source of infection, particularly concerning for \r\nmalignancy in the setting of her anemia and recent thrombosis as \r\nwell. The patient understood the need for outpatient follow up \r\nwith pap smear and IUD removal, and this was relayed to the \r\npatient's PCP as well. There were no other appreciate sources of \r\ninfection on non contrast (in setting ___ on CKD) scans of \r\nthe chest, abdomen and pelvis. The patient remained afebrile and \r\nhemodynamically stable after transfer to the medicine floor from \r\nthe MICU.\r\n\r\n# Abdominal pain: Patient presented with abdominal pain and \r\nfever, was found to have GNR bacteremia speciated to pan \r\nsensitive klebsiella as above. In terms of source of infection, \r\nRUQ ultrasound was without evidence of cholecystitis or CBD \r\ndilatation and CT chest/abdomen was not notable for any \r\nabnormalities that could explain the symptoms. Elevated lipase \r\nwith elevated LFTs was suggestive of pancreatitis; however, her \r\npain was not entirely typical (not prominent in epigastrium) and \r\nCT abdomen did not show signs of pancrteatitis. \r\nCholedocholithiasis with a passed stone was thought to be a \r\npossibility as well given the downtrending LFTS. The \r\ndifferential also included pelvic etiology, though patient \r\ndenied any urinary or vaginal symptoms. The patient's pain \r\nimproved thoughout the admission and the patient was tolerating \r\nPO well on discharge.  \r\n\r\n# Pancreatitis: Patient with lipase >3X ULN and abdominal pain \r\n(though somewhat atypical), however no evidence of pancreatitis \r\non CT (though non contrast given ___ on CKD). Differential \r\nincluded EtOH given history of heavy drinking, biliary sources \r\ngiven elevated LFTs on admission as well. However lipase may \r\nalso have been elevated for alternate etiologies in the setting \r\nof possible GI infection and may not have been representative of \r\ntrue pancreatitis. As above the patient's pain improved \r\nthroughout the admission and was tolerating PO well on \r\ndischarge. \r\n\r\n# Transaminitis: The differential included biliary infection, \r\nhowever  RUQ US without cholecystitis or biliary dilatation, vs. \r\ncholedochlithiasis with passed stone. Could consider \r\ncontribution from heavy EtOH as well, though ration of ALT/AST \r\nless suggestive of this etiology. The patient's LFTs improved \r\nthroughout the hospital course, and T bili normalized. \r\n\r\n# ___: Patient was recently discontinued from \r\nhemodialysis in the past month, as her renal function has \r\nrecovered from a prior ATN. Cr was elevated on admission to 3.3. \r\nShe received fluid and her creatinine gradually decreased. \r\nCreatinine on discharge was 1.8.\r\n\r\n# Anemia: Patient with chronic anemia extensively worked up in \r\nthe past. No evidence of current hemolysis given normalized T \r\nbili. Likely component of hemoconcentration on admission in the \r\nsetting of septic shock. Differential included infection and \r\nmedication (Zosyn) causing bone marrow suppression, as well as \r\nheavy EtOh use. The patient did not require any blood \r\ntransfusions during the admission.\r\n\r\n# EtOH abuse: Patient reported drinking ___ to 1 pint of hard \r\nliquor per day, with her last drink being the day before \r\nadmission. She was placed on CIWA scale, and treated with \r\nmultivitamins and thiamine. The patient attempted to leave AMA \r\nthe day prior to discharge and was evaluated by psychiatry \r\novernight who were concerned that the patient lacked capacity to \r\nat that time. The patient as re evaluated in the morning by \r\npsychiatry and after further discussion was deemed to have \r\ncapacity regarding her plan of care. The patient was instructed \r\nregarding risks of alcohol withdrawal and referred to substance \r\nabuse treatment by psychiatry which she declined.\r\n\r\n# ___ metabolic acidosis: Resolved. Most likely due to \r\nlactic acidosis on presentation\r\n\r\n# Equivocal Serum HCG: Patient denied possibility of pregnancy. \r\nUrine hCG was negative. Patient with IUD in place with plans for \r\noutpatient removal.\r\n\r\n====================\r\nCHRONIC ISSUES\r\n====================\r\n# Hypothyroidism: Patient continued Levothyroxine Sodium 62.5 \r\nmcg PO DAILY. \r\n\r\n# Hx of wet beri beri: Furosemide was held in the setting of \r\nseptic shock and held on discharge given no evidence of volume \r\noverload and soft pressures.\r\n\r\n# HTN: Home Hydrochlorothiazide held as well given infection and \r\nsoft pressures as well. \r\n\r\n# Gout: Patient restarted on home allopurinol. \r\n\r\n====================\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\r\n==================== \r\n- Please continue PO Ciprofloxacin through ___ (___)\r\n- Patient will need pap smear as outpatient for further \r\nevaluation of high risk HPV in setting of bacteremia, anemia, \r\nand thrombosis\r\n- Please discuss with PCP the need for restarting furosemide as \r\nan outpatient.\r\n- Patient will need removal of IUD\r\n- Patient will need removal of IVC filter in future - please \r\ndiscuss with PCP\r\n- ___ obtain CBC and Chem 10 at next PCP appointment for \r\nevaluation of anemia and Creatinine given ___ on CKD\r\n \r\nMedications on Admission:\r\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\r\n1.

Significant improvement in hepatic steatosis. \r\n\r\nCT CHEST W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___  \r\nNormal Chest CT. No evidence of active intrathoracic infection \r\nor malignancy.  Right lower lobe opacity described on recent CT \r\nhas almost completely resolved consistent with resolving \r\natelectasis \r\n \r\nBrief Hospital Course:\r\nMs. ___ is a ___ w/ PMH of EtOH abuse (currently still \r\ndrinking) c/b EtOH hepatitis, Wernicke's encephalopathy, \r\nhypotension likely due to autonomic neuropathy; hypothyroidism, \r\nhypertension, Hx of bariatric surgery, and other issues who was \r\nsent to the ED with hypotension and bandemia concerning for \r\npancreatitis.\r\n\r\n#Septic shock: Patient presented with abdominal pain and fever, \r\nwas found to have hypotension requiring IVF resuscitation and \r\nlevophed for which she had a R IJ CVL placed. She was \r\nsubsequently found to have GNR bacteremia which speciated to pan \r\nsensitive klebsiella in ___ bottles. She was initialy treated \r\nwith broad spectrum antibiotics with IV Vancomycin/Zosyn which \r\nwas narrowed to PO Ciprolfoxacin on discharge. Her blood \r\npressure gradually increased and patient was off levophed with \r\noverall improvement of her symptoms. The etiology of the \r\nbacteremia as thought likely to be intrabdominal given pain and \r\nfurther findings described below in # abdominal pain. The \r\ndifferential also included pelvic process given adnexal \r\ntenderness on physical exam. Urinary etiologies were on the \r\ndifferential, though no urine culture prior to antibiosis \r\nobtained. The patient had previous hematoma evacuation of right \r\nthigh though wound appeared intact without evidence of \r\ninfection. Of note the patient had a history of high risk HPV \r\nwith ASCUS and there was concern that cervical etiologies could \r\nbe the source of infection, particularly concerning for \r\nmalignancy in the setting of her anemia and recent thrombosis as \r\nwell. The patient understood the need for outpatient follow up \r\nwith pap smear and IUD removal, and this was relayed to the \r\npatient's PCP as well. There were no other appreciate sources of \r\ninfection on non contrast (in setting ___ on CKD) scans of \r\nthe chest, abdomen and pelvis. The patient remained afebrile and \r\nhemodynamically stable after transfer to the medicine floor from \r\nthe MICU.\r\n\r\n# Abdominal pain: Patient presented with abdominal pain and \r\nfever, was found to have GNR bacteremia speciated to pan \r\nsensitive klebsiella as above. In terms of source of infection, \r\nRUQ ultrasound was without evidence of cholecystitis or CBD \r\ndilatation and CT chest/abdomen was not notable for any \r\nabnormalities that could explain the symptoms. Elevated lipase \r\nwith elevated LFTs was suggestive of pancreatitis; however, her \r\npain was not entirely typical (not prominent in epigastrium) and \r\nCT abdomen did not show signs of pancrteatitis. \r\nCholedocholithiasis with a passed stone was thought to be a \r\npossibility as well given the downtrending LFTS. The \r\ndifferential also included pelvic etiology, though patient \r\ndenied any urinary or vaginal symptoms. The patient's pain \r\nimproved thoughout the admission and the patient was tolerating \r\nPO well on discharge.  \r\n\r\n# Pancreatitis: Patient with lipase >3X ULN and abdominal pain \r\n(though somewhat atypical), however no evidence of pancreatitis \r\non CT (though non contrast given ___ on CKD). Differential \r\nincluded EtOH given history of heavy drinking, biliary sources \r\ngiven elevated LFTs on admission as well. However lipase may \r\nalso have been elevated for alternate etiologies in the setting \r\nof possible GI infection and may not have been representative of \r\ntrue pancreatitis. As above the patient's pain improved \r\nthroughout the admission and was tolerating PO well on \r\ndischarge. \r\n\r\n# Transaminitis: The differential included biliary infection, \r\nhowever  RUQ US without cholecystitis or biliary dilatation, vs. \r\ncholedochlithiasis with passed stone. Could consider \r\ncontribution from heavy EtOH as well, though ration of ALT/AST \r\nless suggestive of this etiology. The patient's LFTs improved \r\nthroughout the hospital course, and T bili normalized. \r\n\r\n# ___: Patient was recently discontinued from \r\nhemodialysis in the past month, as her renal function has \r\nrecovered from a prior ATN. Cr was elevated on admission to 3.3. \r\nShe received fluid and her creatinine gradually decreased. \r\nCreatinine on discharge was 1.8.\r\n\r\n# Anemia: Patient with chronic anemia extensively worked up in \r\nthe past. No evidence of current hemolysis given normalized T \r\nbili. Likely component of hemoconcentration on admission in the \r\nsetting of septic shock. Differential included infection and \r\nmedication (Zosyn) causing bone marrow suppression, as well as \r\nheavy EtOh use. The patient did not require any blood \r\ntransfusions during the admission.\r\n\r\n# EtOH abuse: Patient reported drinking ___ to 1 pint of hard \r\nliquor per day, with her last drink being the day before \r\nadmission. She was placed on CIWA scale, and treated with \r\nmultivitamins and thiamine. The patient attempted to leave AMA \r\nthe day prior to discharge and was evaluated by psychiatry \r\novernight who were concerned that the patient lacked capacity to \r\nat that time. The patient as re evaluated in the morning by \r\npsychiatry and after further discussion was deemed to have \r\ncapacity regarding her plan of care. The patient was instructed \r\nregarding risks of alcohol withdrawal and referred to substance \r\nabuse treatment by psychiatry which she declined.\r\n\r\n# ___ metabolic acidosis: Resolved. Most likely due to \r\nlactic acidosis on presentation\r\n\r\n# Equivocal Serum HCG: Patient denied possibility of pregnancy. \r\nUrine hCG was negative. Patient with IUD in place with plans for \r\noutpatient removal.\r\n\r\n====================\r\nCHRONIC ISSUES\r\n====================\r\n# Hypothyroidism: Patient continued Levothyroxine Sodium 62.5 \r\nmcg PO DAILY. \r\n\r\n# Hx of wet beri beri: Furosemide was held in the setting of \r\nseptic shock and held on discharge given no evidence of volume \r\noverload and soft pressures.\r\n\r\n# HTN: Home Hydrochlorothiazide held as well given infection and \r\nsoft pressures as well. \r\n\r\n# Gout: Patient restarted on home allopurinol. \r\n\r\n====================\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\r\n==================== \r\n- Please continue PO Ciprofloxacin through ___ (___)\r\n- Patient will need pap smear as outpatient for further \r\nevaluation of high risk HPV in setting of bacteremia, anemia, \r\nand thrombosis\r\n- Please discuss with PCP the need for restarting furosemide as \r\nan outpatient.\r\n- Patient will need removal of IUD\r\n- Patient will need removal of IVC filter in future - please \r\ndiscuss with PCP\r\n- ___ obtain CBC and Chem 10 at next PCP appointment for \r\nevaluation of anemia and Creatinine given ___ on CKD\r\n \r\nMedications on Admission:\r\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\r\n1.

Right lower lobe opacity described on recent CT \r\nhas almost completely resolved consistent with resolving \r\natelectasis \r\n \r\nBrief Hospital Course:\r\nMs. ___ is a ___ w/ PMH of EtOH abuse (currently still \r\ndrinking) c/b EtOH hepatitis, Wernicke's encephalopathy, \r\nhypotension likely due to autonomic neuropathy; hypothyroidism, \r\nhypertension, Hx of bariatric surgery, and other issues who was \r\nsent to the ED with hypotension and bandemia concerning for \r\npancreatitis.\r\n\r\n#Septic shock: Patient presented with abdominal pain and fever, \r\nwas found to have hypotension requiring IVF resuscitation and \r\nlevophed for which she had a R IJ CVL placed. She was \r\nsubsequently found to have GNR bacteremia which speciated to pan \r\nsensitive klebsiella in ___ bottles. She was initialy treated \r\nwith broad spectrum antibiotics with IV Vancomycin/Zosyn which \r\nwas narrowed to PO Ciprolfoxacin on discharge. Her blood \r\npressure gradually increased and patient was off levophed with \r\noverall improvement of her symptoms. The etiology of the \r\nbacteremia as thought likely to be intrabdominal given pain and \r\nfurther findings described below in # abdominal pain. The \r\ndifferential also included pelvic process given adnexal \r\ntenderness on physical exam. Urinary etiologies were on the \r\ndifferential, though no urine culture prior to antibiosis \r\nobtained. The patient had previous hematoma evacuation of right \r\nthigh though wound appeared intact without evidence of \r\ninfection. Of note the patient had a history of high risk HPV \r\nwith ASCUS and there was concern that cervical etiologies could \r\nbe the source of infection, particularly concerning for \r\nmalignancy in the setting of her anemia and recent thrombosis as \r\nwell. The patient understood the need for outpatient follow up \r\nwith pap smear and IUD removal, and this was relayed to the \r\npatient's PCP as well. There were no other appreciate sources of \r\ninfection on non contrast (in setting ___ on CKD) scans of \r\nthe chest, abdomen and pelvis. The patient remained afebrile and \r\nhemodynamically stable after transfer to the medicine floor from \r\nthe MICU.\r\n\r\n# Abdominal pain: Patient presented with abdominal pain and \r\nfever, was found to have GNR bacteremia speciated to pan \r\nsensitive klebsiella as above. In terms of source of infection, \r\nRUQ ultrasound was without evidence of cholecystitis or CBD \r\ndilatation and CT chest/abdomen was not notable for any \r\nabnormalities that could explain the symptoms. Elevated lipase \r\nwith elevated LFTs was suggestive of pancreatitis; however, her \r\npain was not entirely typical (not prominent in epigastrium) and \r\nCT abdomen did not show signs of pancrteatitis. \r\nCholedocholithiasis with a passed stone was thought to be a \r\npossibility as well given the downtrending LFTS. The \r\ndifferential also included pelvic etiology, though patient \r\ndenied any urinary or vaginal symptoms. The patient's pain \r\nimproved thoughout the admission and the patient was tolerating \r\nPO well on discharge.  \r\n\r\n# Pancreatitis: Patient with lipase >3X ULN and abdominal pain \r\n(though somewhat atypical), however no evidence of pancreatitis \r\non CT (though non contrast given ___ on CKD). Differential \r\nincluded EtOH given history of heavy drinking, biliary sources \r\ngiven elevated LFTs on admission as well. However lipase may \r\nalso have been elevated for alternate etiologies in the setting \r\nof possible GI infection and may not have been representative of \r\ntrue pancreatitis. As above the patient's pain improved \r\nthroughout the admission and was tolerating PO well on \r\ndischarge. \r\n\r\n# Transaminitis: The differential included biliary infection, \r\nhowever  RUQ US without cholecystitis or biliary dilatation, vs. \r\ncholedochlithiasis with passed stone. Could consider \r\ncontribution from heavy EtOH as well, though ration of ALT/AST \r\nless suggestive of this etiology. The patient's LFTs improved \r\nthroughout the hospital course, and T bili normalized. \r\n\r\n# ___: Patient was recently discontinued from \r\nhemodialysis in the past month, as her renal function has \r\nrecovered from a prior ATN. Cr was elevated on admission to 3.3. \r\nShe received fluid and her creatinine gradually decreased. \r\nCreatinine on discharge was 1.8.\r\n\r\n# Anemia: Patient with chronic anemia extensively worked up in \r\nthe past. No evidence of current hemolysis given normalized T \r\nbili. Likely component of hemoconcentration on admission in the \r\nsetting of septic shock. Differential included infection and \r\nmedication (Zosyn) causing bone marrow suppression, as well as \r\nheavy EtOh use. The patient did not require any blood \r\ntransfusions during the admission.\r\n\r\n# EtOH abuse: Patient reported drinking ___ to 1 pint of hard \r\nliquor per day, with her last drink being the day before \r\nadmission. She was placed on CIWA scale, and treated with \r\nmultivitamins and thiamine. The patient attempted to leave AMA \r\nthe day prior to discharge and was evaluated by psychiatry \r\novernight who were concerned that the patient lacked capacity to \r\nat that time. The patient as re evaluated in the morning by \r\npsychiatry and after further discussion was deemed to have \r\ncapacity regarding her plan of care. The patient was instructed \r\nregarding risks of alcohol withdrawal and referred to substance \r\nabuse treatment by psychiatry which she declined.\r\n\r\n# ___ metabolic acidosis: Resolved. Most likely due to \r\nlactic acidosis on presentation\r\n\r\n# Equivocal Serum HCG: Patient denied possibility of pregnancy. \r\nUrine hCG was negative. Patient with IUD in place with plans for \r\noutpatient removal.\r\n\r\n====================\r\nCHRONIC ISSUES\r\n====================\r\n# Hypothyroidism: Patient continued Levothyroxine Sodium 62.5 \r\nmcg PO DAILY. \r\n\r\n# Hx of wet beri beri: Furosemide was held in the setting of \r\nseptic shock and held on discharge given no evidence of volume \r\noverload and soft pressures.\r\n\r\n# HTN: Home Hydrochlorothiazide held as well given infection and \r\nsoft pressures as well. \r\n\r\n# Gout: Patient restarted on home allopurinol. \r\n\r\n====================\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\r\n==================== \r\n- Please continue PO Ciprofloxacin through ___ (___)\r\n- Patient will need pap smear as outpatient for further \r\nevaluation of high risk HPV in setting of bacteremia, anemia, \r\nand thrombosis\r\n- Please discuss with PCP the need for restarting furosemide as \r\nan outpatient.\r\n- Patient will need removal of IUD\r\n- Patient will need removal of IVC filter in future - please \r\ndiscuss with PCP\r\n- ___ obtain CBC and Chem 10 at next PCP appointment for \r\nevaluation of anemia and Creatinine given ___ on CKD\r\n \r\nMedications on Admission:\r\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\r\n1.

Right lower lobe opacity described on recent CT \r\nhas almost completely resolved consistent with resolving \r\natelectasis \r\n \r\nBrief Hospital Course:\r\nMs. ___ is a ___ w/ PMH of EtOH abuse (currently still \r\ndrinking) c/b EtOH hepatitis, Wernicke's encephalopathy, \r\nhypotension likely due to autonomic neuropathy; hypothyroidism, \r\nhypertension, Hx of bariatric surgery, and other issues who was \r\nsent to the ED with hypotension and bandemia concerning for \r\npancreatitis.\r\n\r\n#Septic shock: Patient presented with abdominal pain and fever, \r\nwas found to have hypotension requiring IVF resuscitation and \r\nlevophed for which she had a R IJ CVL placed. She was \r\nsubsequently found to have GNR bacteremia which speciated to pan \r\nsensitive klebsiella in ___ bottles. She was initialy treated \r\nwith broad spectrum antibiotics with IV Vancomycin/Zosyn which \r\nwas narrowed to PO Ciprolfoxacin on discharge. Her blood \r\npressure gradually increased and patient was off levophed with \r\noverall improvement of her symptoms. The etiology of the \r\nbacteremia as thought likely to be intrabdominal given pain and \r\nfurther findings described below in # abdominal pain. The \r\ndifferential also included pelvic process given adnexal \r\ntenderness on physical exam. Urinary etiologies were on the \r\ndifferential, though no urine culture prior to antibiosis \r\nobtained. The patient had previous hematoma evacuation of right \r\nthigh though wound appeared intact without evidence of \r\ninfection. Of note the patient had a history of high risk HPV \r\nwith ASCUS and there was concern that cervical etiologies could \r\nbe the source of infection, particularly concerning for \r\nmalignancy in the setting of her anemia and recent thrombosis as \r\nwell. The patient understood the need for outpatient follow up \r\nwith pap smear and IUD removal, and this was relayed to the \r\npatient's PCP as well. There were no other appreciate sources of \r\ninfection on non contrast (in setting ___ on CKD) scans of \r\nthe chest, abdomen and pelvis. The patient remained afebrile and \r\nhemodynamically stable after transfer to the medicine floor from \r\nthe MICU.\r\n\r\n# Abdominal pain: Patient presented with abdominal pain and \r\nfever, was found to have GNR bacteremia speciated to pan \r\nsensitive klebsiella as above. In terms of source of infection, \r\nRUQ ultrasound was without evidence of cholecystitis or CBD \r\ndilatation and CT chest/abdomen was not notable for any \r\nabnormalities that could explain the symptoms. Elevated lipase \r\nwith elevated LFTs was suggestive of pancreatitis; however, her \r\npain was not entirely typical (not prominent in epigastrium) and \r\nCT abdomen did not show signs of pancrteatitis. \r\nCholedocholithiasis with a passed stone was thought to be a \r\npossibility as well given the downtrending LFTS. The \r\ndifferential also included pelvic etiology, though patient \r\ndenied any urinary or vaginal symptoms. The patient's pain \r\nimproved thoughout the admission and the patient was tolerating \r\nPO well on discharge.  \r\n\r\n# Pancreatitis: Patient with lipase >3X ULN and abdominal pain \r\n(though somewhat atypical), however no evidence of pancreatitis \r\non CT (though non contrast given ___ on CKD). Differential \r\nincluded EtOH given history of heavy drinking, biliary sources \r\ngiven elevated LFTs on admission as well. However lipase may \r\nalso have been elevated for alternate etiologies in the setting \r\nof possible GI infection and may not have been representative of \r\ntrue pancreatitis. As above the patient's pain improved \r\nthroughout the admission and was tolerating PO well on \r\ndischarge. \r\n\r\n# Transaminitis: The differential included biliary infection, \r\nhowever  RUQ US without cholecystitis or biliary dilatation, vs. \r\ncholedochlithiasis with passed stone. Could consider \r\ncontribution from heavy EtOH as well, though ration of ALT/AST \r\nless suggestive of this etiology. The patient's LFTs improved \r\nthroughout the hospital course, and T bili normalized. \r\n\r\n# ___: Patient was recently discontinued from \r\nhemodialysis in the past month, as her renal function has \r\nrecovered from a prior ATN. Cr was elevated on admission to 3.3. \r\nShe received fluid and her creatinine gradually decreased. \r\nCreatinine on discharge was 1.8.\r\n\r\n# Anemia: Patient with chronic anemia extensively worked up in \r\nthe past. No evidence of current hemolysis given normalized T \r\nbili. Likely component of hemoconcentration on admission in the \r\nsetting of septic shock. Differential included infection and \r\nmedication (Zosyn) causing bone marrow suppression, as well as \r\nheavy EtOh use. The patient did not require any blood \r\ntransfusions during the admission.\r\n\r\n# EtOH abuse: Patient reported drinking ___ to 1 pint of hard \r\nliquor per day, with her last drink being the day before \r\nadmission. She was placed on CIWA scale, and treated with \r\nmultivitamins and thiamine. The patient attempted to leave AMA \r\nthe day prior to discharge and was evaluated by psychiatry \r\novernight who were concerned that the patient lacked capacity to \r\nat that time. The patient as re evaluated in the morning by \r\npsychiatry and after further discussion was deemed to have \r\ncapacity regarding her plan of care. The patient was instructed \r\nregarding risks of alcohol withdrawal and referred to substance \r\nabuse treatment by psychiatry which she declined.\r\n\r\n# ___ metabolic acidosis: Resolved. Most likely due to \r\nlactic acidosis on presentation\r\n\r\n# Equivocal Serum HCG: Patient denied possibility of pregnancy. \r\nUrine hCG was negative. Patient with IUD in place with plans for \r\noutpatient removal.\r\n\r\n====================\r\nCHRONIC ISSUES\r\n====================\r\n# Hypothyroidism: Patient continued Levothyroxine Sodium 62.5 \r\nmcg PO DAILY. \r\n\r\n# Hx of wet beri beri: Furosemide was held in the setting of \r\nseptic shock and held on discharge given no evidence of volume \r\noverload and soft pressures.\r\n\r\n# HTN: Home Hydrochlorothiazide held as well given infection and \r\nsoft pressures as well. \r\n\r\n# Gout: Patient restarted on home allopurinol. \r\n\r\n====================\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\r\n==================== \r\n- Please continue PO Ciprofloxacin through ___ (___)\r\n- Patient will need pap smear as outpatient for further \r\nevaluation of high risk HPV in setting of bacteremia, anemia, \r\nand thrombosis\r\n- Please discuss with PCP the need for restarting furosemide as \r\nan outpatient.\r\n- Patient will need removal of IUD\r\n- Patient will need removal of IVC filter in future - please \r\ndiscuss with PCP\r\n- ___ obtain CBC and Chem 10 at next PCP appointment for \r\nevaluation of anemia and Creatinine given ___ on CKD\r\n \r\nMedications on Admission:\r\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\r\n1.

Right lower lobe opacity described on recent CT \r\nhas almost completely resolved consistent with resolving \r\natelectasis \r\n \r\nBrief Hospital Course:\r\nMs. ___ is a ___ w/ PMH of EtOH abuse (currently still \r\ndrinking) c/b EtOH hepatitis, Wernicke's encephalopathy, \r\nhypotension likely due to autonomic neuropathy; hypothyroidism, \r\nhypertension, Hx of bariatric surgery, and other issues who was \r\nsent to the ED with hypotension and bandemia concerning for \r\npancreatitis.\r\n\r\n#Septic shock: Patient presented with abdominal pain and fever, \r\nwas found to have hypotension requiring IVF resuscitation and \r\nlevophed for which she had a R IJ CVL placed. She was \r\nsubsequently found to have GNR bacteremia which speciated to pan \r\nsensitive klebsiella in ___ bottles. She was initialy treated \r\nwith broad spectrum antibiotics with IV Vancomycin/Zosyn which \r\nwas narrowed to PO Ciprolfoxacin on discharge. Her blood \r\npressure gradually increased and patient was off levophed with \r\noverall improvement of her symptoms. The etiology of the \r\nbacteremia as thought likely to be intrabdominal given pain and \r\nfurther findings described below in # abdominal pain. The \r\ndifferential also included pelvic process given adnexal \r\ntenderness on physical exam. Urinary etiologies were on the \r\ndifferential, though no urine culture prior to antibiosis \r\nobtained. The patient had previous hematoma evacuation of right \r\nthigh though wound appeared intact without evidence of \r\ninfection. Of note the patient had a history of high risk HPV \r\nwith ASCUS and there was concern that cervical etiologies could \r\nbe the source of infection, particularly concerning for \r\nmalignancy in the setting of her anemia and recent thrombosis as \r\nwell. The patient understood the need for outpatient follow up \r\nwith pap smear and IUD removal, and this was relayed to the \r\npatient's PCP as well. There were no other appreciate sources of \r\ninfection on non contrast (in setting ___ on CKD) scans of \r\nthe chest, abdomen and pelvis. The patient remained afebrile and \r\nhemodynamically stable after transfer to the medicine floor from \r\nthe MICU.\r\n\r\n# Abdominal pain: Patient presented with abdominal pain and \r\nfever, was found to have GNR bacteremia speciated to pan \r\nsensitive klebsiella as above. In terms of source of infection, \r\nRUQ ultrasound was without evidence of cholecystitis or CBD \r\ndilatation and CT chest/abdomen was not notable for any \r\nabnormalities that could explain the symptoms. Elevated lipase \r\nwith elevated LFTs was suggestive of pancreatitis; however, her \r\npain was not entirely typical (not prominent in epigastrium) and \r\nCT abdomen did not show signs of pancrteatitis. \r\nCholedocholithiasis with a passed stone was thought to be a \r\npossibility as well given the downtrending LFTS. The \r\ndifferential also included pelvic etiology, though patient \r\ndenied any urinary or vaginal symptoms. The patient's pain \r\nimproved thoughout the admission and the patient was tolerating \r\nPO well on discharge.  \r\n\r\n# Pancreatitis: Patient with lipase >3X ULN and abdominal pain \r\n(though somewhat atypical), however no evidence of pancreatitis \r\non CT (though non contrast given ___ on CKD). Differential \r\nincluded EtOH given history of heavy drinking, biliary sources \r\ngiven elevated LFTs on admission as well. However lipase may \r\nalso have been elevated for alternate etiologies in the setting \r\nof possible GI infection and may not have been representative of \r\ntrue pancreatitis. As above the patient's pain improved \r\nthroughout the admission and was tolerating PO well on \r\ndischarge. \r\n\r\n# Transaminitis: The differential included biliary infection, \r\nhowever  RUQ US without cholecystitis or biliary dilatation, vs. \r\ncholedochlithiasis with passed stone. Could consider \r\ncontribution from heavy EtOH as well, though ration of ALT/AST \r\nless suggestive of this etiology. The patient's LFTs improved \r\nthroughout the hospital course, and T bili normalized. \r\n\r\n# ___: Patient was recently discontinued from \r\nhemodialysis in the past month, as her renal function has \r\nrecovered from a prior ATN. Cr was elevated on admission to 3.3. \r\nShe received fluid and her creatinine gradually decreased. \r\nCreatinine on discharge was 1.8.\r\n\r\n# Anemia: Patient with chronic anemia extensively worked up in \r\nthe past. No evidence of current hemolysis given normalized T \r\nbili. Likely component of hemoconcentration on admission in the \r\nsetting of septic shock. Differential included infection and \r\nmedication (Zosyn) causing bone marrow suppression, as well as \r\nheavy EtOh use. The patient did not require any blood \r\ntransfusions during the admission.\r\n\r\n# EtOH abuse: Patient reported drinking ___ to 1 pint of hard \r\nliquor per day, with her last drink being the day before \r\nadmission. She was placed on CIWA scale, and treated with \r\nmultivitamins and thiamine. The patient attempted to leave AMA \r\nthe day prior to discharge and was evaluated by psychiatry \r\novernight who were concerned that the patient lacked capacity to \r\nat that time. The patient as re evaluated in the morning by \r\npsychiatry and after further discussion was deemed to have \r\ncapacity regarding her plan of care. The patient was instructed \r\nregarding risks of alcohol withdrawal and referred to substance \r\nabuse treatment by psychiatry which she declined.\r\n\r\n# ___ metabolic acidosis: Resolved. Most likely due to \r\nlactic acidosis on presentation\r\n\r\n# Equivocal Serum HCG: Patient denied possibility of pregnancy. \r\nUrine hCG was negative. Patient with IUD in place with plans for \r\noutpatient removal.\r\n\r\n====================\r\nCHRONIC ISSUES\r\n====================\r\n# Hypothyroidism: Patient continued Levothyroxine Sodium 62.5 \r\nmcg PO DAILY. \r\n\r\n# Hx of wet beri beri: Furosemide was held in the setting of \r\nseptic shock and held on discharge given no evidence of volume \r\noverload and soft pressures.\r\n\r\n# HTN: Home Hydrochlorothiazide held as well given infection and \r\nsoft pressures as well. \r\n\r\n# Gout: Patient restarted on home allopurinol. \r\n\r\n====================\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\r\n==================== \r\n- Please continue PO Ciprofloxacin through ___ (___)\r\n- Patient will need pap smear as outpatient for further \r\nevaluation of high risk HPV in setting of bacteremia, anemia, \r\nand thrombosis\r\n- Please discuss with PCP the need for restarting furosemide as \r\nan outpatient.\r\n- Patient will need removal of IUD\r\n- Patient will need removal of IVC filter in future - please \r\ndiscuss with PCP\r\n- ___ obtain CBC and Chem 10 at next PCP appointment for \r\nevaluation of anemia and Creatinine given ___ on CKD\r\n \r\nMedications on Admission:\r\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\r\n1.

Right lower lobe opacity described on recent CT \r\nhas almost completely resolved consistent with resolving \r\natelectasis \r\n \r\nBrief Hospital Course:\r\nMs. ___ is a ___ w/ PMH of EtOH abuse (currently still \r\ndrinking) c/b EtOH hepatitis, Wernicke's encephalopathy, \r\nhypotension likely due to autonomic neuropathy; hypothyroidism, \r\nhypertension, Hx of bariatric surgery, and other issues who was \r\nsent to the ED with hypotension and bandemia concerning for \r\npancreatitis.\r\n\r\n#Septic shock: Patient presented with abdominal pain and fever, \r\nwas found to have hypotension requiring IVF resuscitation and \r\nlevophed for which she had a R IJ CVL placed. She was \r\nsubsequently found to have GNR bacteremia which speciated to pan \r\nsensitive klebsiella in ___ bottles. She was initialy treated \r\nwith broad spectrum antibiotics with IV Vancomycin/Zosyn which \r\nwas narrowed to PO Ciprolfoxacin on discharge. Her blood \r\npressure gradually increased and patient was off levophed with \r\noverall improvement of her symptoms. The etiology of the \r\nbacteremia as thought likely to be intrabdominal given pain and \r\nfurther findings described below in # abdominal pain. The \r\ndifferential also included pelvic process given adnexal \r\ntenderness on physical exam. Urinary etiologies were on the \r\ndifferential, though no urine culture prior to antibiosis \r\nobtained. The patient had previous hematoma evacuation of right \r\nthigh though wound appeared intact without evidence of \r\ninfection. Of note the patient had a history of high risk HPV \r\nwith ASCUS and there was concern that cervical etiologies could \r\nbe the source of infection, particularly concerning for \r\nmalignancy in the setting of her anemia and recent thrombosis as \r\nwell. The patient understood the need for outpatient follow up \r\nwith pap smear and IUD removal, and this was relayed to the \r\npatient's PCP as well. There were no other appreciate sources of \r\ninfection on non contrast (in setting ___ on CKD) scans of \r\nthe chest, abdomen and pelvis. The patient remained afebrile and \r\nhemodynamically stable after transfer to the medicine floor from \r\nthe MICU.\r\n\r\n# Abdominal pain: Patient presented with abdominal pain and \r\nfever, was found to have GNR bacteremia speciated to pan \r\nsensitive klebsiella as above. In terms of source of infection, \r\nRUQ ultrasound was without evidence of cholecystitis or CBD \r\ndilatation and CT chest/abdomen was not notable for any \r\nabnormalities that could explain the symptoms. Elevated lipase \r\nwith elevated LFTs was suggestive of pancreatitis; however, her \r\npain was not entirely typical (not prominent in epigastrium) and \r\nCT abdomen did not show signs of pancrteatitis. \r\nCholedocholithiasis with a passed stone was thought to be a \r\npossibility as well given the downtrending LFTS. The \r\ndifferential also included pelvic etiology, though patient \r\ndenied any urinary or vaginal symptoms. The patient's pain \r\nimproved thoughout the admission and the patient was tolerating \r\nPO well on discharge.  \r\n\r\n# Pancreatitis: Patient with lipase >3X ULN and abdominal pain \r\n(though somewhat atypical), however no evidence of pancreatitis \r\non CT (though non contrast given ___ on CKD). Differential \r\nincluded EtOH given history of heavy drinking, biliary sources \r\ngiven elevated LFTs on admission as well. However lipase may \r\nalso have been elevated for alternate etiologies in the setting \r\nof possible GI infection and may not have been representative of \r\ntrue pancreatitis. As above the patient's pain improved \r\nthroughout the admission and was tolerating PO well on \r\ndischarge. \r\n\r\n# Transaminitis: The differential included biliary infection, \r\nhowever  RUQ US without cholecystitis or biliary dilatation, vs. \r\ncholedochlithiasis with passed stone. Could consider \r\ncontribution from heavy EtOH as well, though ration of ALT/AST \r\nless suggestive of this etiology. The patient's LFTs improved \r\nthroughout the hospital course, and T bili normalized. \r\n\r\n# ___: Patient was recently discontinued from \r\nhemodialysis in the past month, as her renal function has \r\nrecovered from a prior ATN. Cr was elevated on admission to 3.3. \r\nShe received fluid and her creatinine gradually decreased. \r\nCreatinine on discharge was 1.8.\r\n\r\n# Anemia: Patient with chronic anemia extensively worked up in \r\nthe past. No evidence of current hemolysis given normalized T \r\nbili. Likely component of hemoconcentration on admission in the \r\nsetting of septic shock. Differential included infection and \r\nmedication (Zosyn) causing bone marrow suppression, as well as \r\nheavy EtOh use. The patient did not require any blood \r\ntransfusions during the admission.\r\n\r\n# EtOH abuse: Patient reported drinking ___ to 1 pint of hard \r\nliquor per day, with her last drink being the day before \r\nadmission. She was placed on CIWA scale, and treated with \r\nmultivitamins and thiamine. The patient attempted to leave AMA \r\nthe day prior to discharge and was evaluated by psychiatry \r\novernight who were concerned that the patient lacked capacity to \r\nat that time. The patient as re evaluated in the morning by \r\npsychiatry and after further discussion was deemed to have \r\ncapacity regarding her plan of care. The patient was instructed \r\nregarding risks of alcohol withdrawal and referred to substance \r\nabuse treatment by psychiatry which she declined.\r\n\r\n# ___ metabolic acidosis: Resolved. Most likely due to \r\nlactic acidosis on presentation\r\n\r\n# Equivocal Serum HCG: Patient denied possibility of pregnancy. \r\nUrine hCG was negative. Patient with IUD in place with plans for \r\noutpatient removal.\r\n\r\n====================\r\nCHRONIC ISSUES\r\n====================\r\n# Hypothyroidism: Patient continued Levothyroxine Sodium 62.5 \r\nmcg PO DAILY. \r\n\r\n# Hx of wet beri beri: Furosemide was held in the setting of \r\nseptic shock and held on discharge given no evidence of volume \r\noverload and soft pressures.\r\n\r\n# HTN: Home Hydrochlorothiazide held as well given infection and \r\nsoft pressures as well. \r\n\r\n# Gout: Patient restarted on home allopurinol. \r\n\r\n====================\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\r\n==================== \r\n- Please continue PO Ciprofloxacin through ___ (___)\r\n- Patient will need pap smear as outpatient for further \r\nevaluation of high risk HPV in setting of bacteremia, anemia, \r\nand thrombosis\r\n- Please discuss with PCP the need for restarting furosemide as \r\nan outpatient.\r\n- Patient will need removal of IUD\r\n- Patient will need removal of IVC filter in future - please \r\ndiscuss with PCP\r\n- ___ obtain CBC and Chem 10 at next PCP appointment for \r\nevaluation of anemia and Creatinine given ___ on CKD\r\n \r\nMedications on Admission:\r\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\r\n1.

Right lower lobe opacity described on recent CT \r\nhas almost completely resolved consistent with resolving \r\natelectasis \r\n \r\nBrief Hospital Course:\r\nMs. ___ is a ___ w/ PMH of EtOH abuse (currently still \r\ndrinking) c/b EtOH hepatitis, Wernicke's encephalopathy, \r\nhypotension likely due to autonomic neuropathy; hypothyroidism, \r\nhypertension, Hx of bariatric surgery, and other issues who was \r\nsent to the ED with hypotension and bandemia concerning for \r\npancreatitis.\r\n\r\n#Septic shock: Patient presented with abdominal pain and fever, \r\nwas found to have hypotension requiring IVF resuscitation and \r\nlevophed for which she had a R IJ CVL placed. She was \r\nsubsequently found to have GNR bacteremia which speciated to pan \r\nsensitive klebsiella in ___ bottles. She was initialy treated \r\nwith broad spectrum antibiotics with IV Vancomycin/Zosyn which \r\nwas narrowed to PO Ciprolfoxacin on discharge. Her blood \r\npressure gradually increased and patient was off levophed with \r\noverall improvement of her symptoms. The etiology of the \r\nbacteremia as thought likely to be intrabdominal given pain and \r\nfurther findings described below in # abdominal pain. The \r\ndifferential also included pelvic process given adnexal \r\ntenderness on physical exam. Urinary etiologies were on the \r\ndifferential, though no urine culture prior to antibiosis \r\nobtained. The patient had previous hematoma evacuation of right \r\nthigh though wound appeared intact without evidence of \r\ninfection. Of note the patient had a history of high risk HPV \r\nwith ASCUS and there was concern that cervical etiologies could \r\nbe the source of infection, particularly concerning for \r\nmalignancy in the setting of her anemia and recent thrombosis as \r\nwell. The patient understood the need for outpatient follow up \r\nwith pap smear and IUD removal, and this was relayed to the \r\npatient's PCP as well. There were no other appreciate sources of \r\ninfection on non contrast (in setting ___ on CKD) scans of \r\nthe chest, abdomen and pelvis. The patient remained afebrile and \r\nhemodynamically stable after transfer to the medicine floor from \r\nthe MICU.\r\n\r\n# Abdominal pain: Patient presented with abdominal pain and \r\nfever, was found to have GNR bacteremia speciated to pan \r\nsensitive klebsiella as above. In terms of source of infection, \r\nRUQ ultrasound was without evidence of cholecystitis or CBD \r\ndilatation and CT chest/abdomen was not notable for any \r\nabnormalities that could explain the symptoms. Elevated lipase \r\nwith elevated LFTs was suggestive of pancreatitis; however, her \r\npain was not entirely typical (not prominent in epigastrium) and \r\nCT abdomen did not show signs of pancrteatitis. \r\nCholedocholithiasis with a passed stone was thought to be a \r\npossibility as well given the downtrending LFTS. The \r\ndifferential also included pelvic etiology, though patient \r\ndenied any urinary or vaginal symptoms. The patient's pain \r\nimproved thoughout the admission and the patient was tolerating \r\nPO well on discharge.  \r\n\r\n# Pancreatitis: Patient with lipase >3X ULN and abdominal pain \r\n(though somewhat atypical), however no evidence of pancreatitis \r\non CT (though non contrast given ___ on CKD). Differential \r\nincluded EtOH given history of heavy drinking, biliary sources \r\ngiven elevated LFTs on admission as well. However lipase may \r\nalso have been elevated for alternate etiologies in the setting \r\nof possible GI infection and may not have been representative of \r\ntrue pancreatitis. As above the patient's pain improved \r\nthroughout the admission and was tolerating PO well on \r\ndischarge. \r\n\r\n# Transaminitis: The differential included biliary infection, \r\nhowever  RUQ US without cholecystitis or biliary dilatation, vs. \r\ncholedochlithiasis with passed stone. Could consider \r\ncontribution from heavy EtOH as well, though ration of ALT/AST \r\nless suggestive of this etiology. The patient's LFTs improved \r\nthroughout the hospital course, and T bili normalized. \r\n\r\n# ___: Patient was recently discontinued from \r\nhemodialysis in the past month, as her renal function has \r\nrecovered from a prior ATN. Cr was elevated on admission to 3.3. \r\nShe received fluid and her creatinine gradually decreased. \r\nCreatinine on discharge was 1.8.\r\n\r\n# Anemia: Patient with chronic anemia extensively worked up in \r\nthe past. No evidence of current hemolysis given normalized T \r\nbili. Likely component of hemoconcentration on admission in the \r\nsetting of septic shock. Differential included infection and \r\nmedication (Zosyn) causing bone marrow suppression, as well as \r\nheavy EtOh use. The patient did not require any blood \r\ntransfusions during the admission.\r\n\r\n# EtOH abuse: Patient reported drinking ___ to 1 pint of hard \r\nliquor per day, with her last drink being the day before \r\nadmission. She was placed on CIWA scale, and treated with \r\nmultivitamins and thiamine. The patient attempted to leave AMA \r\nthe day prior to discharge and was evaluated by psychiatry \r\novernight who were concerned that the patient lacked capacity to \r\nat that time. The patient as re evaluated in the morning by \r\npsychiatry and after further discussion was deemed to have \r\ncapacity regarding her plan of care. The patient was instructed \r\nregarding risks of alcohol withdrawal and referred to substance \r\nabuse treatment by psychiatry which she declined.\r\n\r\n# ___ metabolic acidosis: Resolved. Most likely due to \r\nlactic acidosis on presentation\r\n\r\n# Equivocal Serum HCG: Patient denied possibility of pregnancy. \r\nUrine hCG was negative.

Significant improvement in hepatic steatosis. \r\n\r\nCT CHEST W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___  \r\nNormal Chest CT. No evidence of active intrathoracic infection \r\nor malignancy.  Right lower lobe opacity described on recent CT \r\nhas almost completely resolved consistent with resolving \r\natelectasis \r\n \r\nBrief Hospital Course:\r\nMs. ___ is a ___ w/ PMH of EtOH abuse (currently still \r\ndrinking) c/b EtOH hepatitis, Wernicke's encephalopathy, \r\nhypotension likely due to autonomic neuropathy; hypothyroidism, \r\nhypertension, Hx of bariatric surgery, and other issues who was \r\nsent to the ED with hypotension and bandemia concerning for \r\npancreatitis.\r\n\r\n#Septic shock: Patient presented with abdominal pain and fever, \r\nwas found to have hypotension requiring IVF resuscitation and \r\nlevophed for which she had a R IJ CVL placed. She was \r\nsubsequently found to have GNR bacteremia which speciated to pan \r\nsensitive klebsiella in ___ bottles. She was initialy treated \r\nwith broad spectrum antibiotics with IV Vancomycin/Zosyn which \r\nwas narrowed to PO Ciprolfoxacin on discharge. Her blood \r\npressure gradually increased and patient was off levophed with \r\noverall improvement of her symptoms. The etiology of the \r\nbacteremia as thought likely to be intrabdominal given pain and \r\nfurther findings described below in # abdominal pain. The \r\ndifferential also included pelvic process given adnexal \r\ntenderness on physical exam. Urinary etiologies were on the \r\ndifferential, though no urine culture prior to antibiosis \r\nobtained. The patient had previous hematoma evacuation of right \r\nthigh though wound appeared intact without evidence of \r\ninfection. Of note the patient had a history of high risk HPV \r\nwith ASCUS and there was concern that cervical etiologies could \r\nbe the source of infection, particularly concerning for \r\nmalignancy in the setting of her anemia and recent thrombosis as \r\nwell. The patient understood the need for outpatient follow up \r\nwith pap smear and IUD removal, and this was relayed to the \r\npatient's PCP as well. There were no other appreciate sources of \r\ninfection on non contrast (in setting ___ on CKD) scans of \r\nthe chest, abdomen and pelvis. The patient remained afebrile and \r\nhemodynamically stable after transfer to the medicine floor from \r\nthe MICU.\r\n\r\n# Abdominal pain: Patient presented with abdominal pain and \r\nfever, was found to have GNR bacteremia speciated to pan \r\nsensitive klebsiella as above. In terms of source of infection, \r\nRUQ ultrasound was without evidence of cholecystitis or CBD \r\ndilatation and CT chest/abdomen was not notable for any \r\nabnormalities that could explain the symptoms. Elevated lipase \r\nwith elevated LFTs was suggestive of pancreatitis; however, her \r\npain was not entirely typical (not prominent in epigastrium) and \r\nCT abdomen did not show signs of pancrteatitis. \r\nCholedocholithiasis with a passed stone was thought to be a \r\npossibility as well given the downtrending LFTS. The \r\ndifferential also included pelvic etiology, though patient \r\ndenied any urinary or vaginal symptoms. The patient's pain \r\nimproved thoughout the admission and the patient was tolerating \r\nPO well on discharge.  \r\n\r\n# Pancreatitis: Patient with lipase >3X ULN and abdominal pain \r\n(though somewhat atypical), however no evidence of pancreatitis \r\non CT (though non contrast given ___ on CKD). Differential \r\nincluded EtOH given history of heavy drinking, biliary sources \r\ngiven elevated LFTs on admission as well. However lipase may \r\nalso have been elevated for alternate etiologies in the setting \r\nof possible GI infection and may not have been representative of \r\ntrue pancreatitis. As above the patient's pain improved \r\nthroughout the admission and was tolerating PO well on \r\ndischarge. \r\n\r\n# Transaminitis: The differential included biliary infection, \r\nhowever  RUQ US without cholecystitis or biliary dilatation, vs. \r\ncholedochlithiasis with passed stone. Could consider \r\ncontribution from heavy EtOH as well, though ration of ALT/AST \r\nless suggestive of this etiology. The patient's LFTs improved \r\nthroughout the hospital course, and T bili normalized. \r\n\r\n# ___: Patient was recently discontinued from \r\nhemodialysis in the past month, as her renal function has \r\nrecovered from a prior ATN. Cr was elevated on admission to 3.3. \r\nShe received fluid and her creatinine gradually decreased. \r\nCreatinine on discharge was 1.8.\r\n\r\n# Anemia: Patient with chronic anemia extensively worked up in \r\nthe past. No evidence of current hemolysis given normalized T \r\nbili. Likely component of hemoconcentration on admission in the \r\nsetting of septic shock. Differential included infection and \r\nmedication (Zosyn) causing bone marrow suppression, as well as \r\nheavy EtOh use. The patient did not require any blood \r\ntransfusions during the admission.\r\n\r\n# EtOH abuse: Patient reported drinking ___ to 1 pint of hard \r\nliquor per day, with her last drink being the day before \r\nadmission. She was placed on CIWA scale, and treated with \r\nmultivitamins and thiamine. The patient attempted to leave AMA \r\nthe day prior to discharge and was evaluated by psychiatry \r\novernight who were concerned that the patient lacked capacity to \r\nat that time. The patient as re evaluated in the morning by \r\npsychiatry and after further discussion was deemed to have \r\ncapacity regarding her plan of care. The patient was instructed \r\nregarding risks of alcohol withdrawal and referred to substance \r\nabuse treatment by psychiatry which she declined.\r\n\r\n# ___ metabolic acidosis: Resolved.

Significant improvement in hepatic steatosis. \r\n\r\nCT CHEST W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___  \r\nNormal Chest CT. No evidence of active intrathoracic infection \r\nor malignancy.  Right lower lobe opacity described on recent CT \r\nhas almost completely resolved consistent with resolving \r\natelectasis \r\n \r\nBrief Hospital Course:\r\nMs. ___ is a ___ w/ PMH of EtOH abuse (currently still \r\ndrinking) c/b EtOH hepatitis, Wernicke's encephalopathy, \r\nhypotension likely due to autonomic neuropathy; hypothyroidism, \r\nhypertension, Hx of bariatric surgery, and other issues who was \r\nsent to the ED with hypotension and bandemia concerning for \r\npancreatitis.\r\n\r\n#Septic shock: Patient presented with abdominal pain and fever, \r\nwas found to have hypotension requiring IVF resuscitation and \r\nlevophed for which she had a R IJ CVL placed. She was \r\nsubsequently found to have GNR bacteremia which speciated to pan \r\nsensitive klebsiella in ___ bottles. She was initialy treated \r\nwith broad spectrum antibiotics with IV Vancomycin/Zosyn which \r\nwas narrowed to PO Ciprolfoxacin on discharge. Her blood \r\npressure gradually increased and patient was off levophed with \r\noverall improvement of her symptoms. The etiology of the \r\nbacteremia as thought likely to be intrabdominal given pain and \r\nfurther findings described below in # abdominal pain. The \r\ndifferential also included pelvic process given adnexal \r\ntenderness on physical exam. Urinary etiologies were on the \r\ndifferential, though no urine culture prior to antibiosis \r\nobtained. The patient had previous hematoma evacuation of right \r\nthigh though wound appeared intact without evidence of \r\ninfection. Of note the patient had a history of high risk HPV \r\nwith ASCUS and there was concern that cervical etiologies could \r\nbe the source of infection, particularly concerning for \r\nmalignancy in the setting of her anemia and recent thrombosis as \r\nwell. The patient understood the need for outpatient follow up \r\nwith pap smear and IUD removal, and this was relayed to the \r\npatient's PCP as well. There were no other appreciate sources of \r\ninfection on non contrast (in setting ___ on CKD) scans of \r\nthe chest, abdomen and pelvis. The patient remained afebrile and \r\nhemodynamically stable after transfer to the medicine floor from \r\nthe MICU.\r\n\r\n# Abdominal pain: Patient presented with abdominal pain and \r\nfever, was found to have GNR bacteremia speciated to pan \r\nsensitive klebsiella as above. In terms of source of infection, \r\nRUQ ultrasound was without evidence of cholecystitis or CBD \r\ndilatation and CT chest/abdomen was not notable for any \r\nabnormalities that could explain the symptoms. Elevated lipase \r\nwith elevated LFTs was suggestive of pancreatitis; however, her \r\npain was not entirely typical (not prominent in epigastrium) and \r\nCT abdomen did not show signs of pancrteatitis. \r\nCholedocholithiasis with a passed stone was thought to be a \r\npossibility as well given the downtrending LFTS. The \r\ndifferential also included pelvic etiology, though patient \r\ndenied any urinary or vaginal symptoms. The patient's pain \r\nimproved thoughout the admission and the patient was tolerating \r\nPO well on discharge.  \r\n\r\n# Pancreatitis: Patient with lipase >3X ULN and abdominal pain \r\n(though somewhat atypical), however no evidence of pancreatitis \r\non CT (though non contrast given ___ on CKD). Differential \r\nincluded EtOH given history of heavy drinking, biliary sources \r\ngiven elevated LFTs on admission as well. However lipase may \r\nalso have been elevated for alternate etiologies in the setting \r\nof possible GI infection and may not have been representative of \r\ntrue pancreatitis. As above the patient's pain improved \r\nthroughout the admission and was tolerating PO well on \r\ndischarge. \r\n\r\n# Transaminitis: The differential included biliary infection, \r\nhowever  RUQ US without cholecystitis or biliary dilatation, vs. \r\ncholedochlithiasis with passed stone. Could consider \r\ncontribution from heavy EtOH as well, though ration of ALT/AST \r\nless suggestive of this etiology. The patient's LFTs improved \r\nthroughout the hospital course, and T bili normalized. \r\n\r\n# ___: Patient was recently discontinued from \r\nhemodialysis in the past month, as her renal function has \r\nrecovered from a prior ATN. Cr was elevated on admission to 3.3. \r\nShe received fluid and her creatinine gradually decreased. \r\nCreatinine on discharge was 1.8.\r\n\r\n# Anemia: Patient with chronic anemia extensively worked up in \r\nthe past. No evidence of current hemolysis given normalized T \r\nbili. Likely component of hemoconcentration on admission in the \r\nsetting of septic shock. Differential included infection and \r\nmedication (Zosyn) causing bone marrow suppression, as well as \r\nheavy EtOh use. The patient did not require any blood \r\ntransfusions during the admission.\r\n\r\n# EtOH abuse: Patient reported drinking ___ to 1 pint of hard \r\nliquor per day, with her last drink being the day before \r\nadmission. She was placed on CIWA scale, and treated with \r\nmultivitamins and thiamine. The patient attempted to leave AMA \r\nthe day prior to discharge and was evaluated by psychiatry \r\novernight who were concerned that the patient lacked capacity to \r\nat that time. The patient as re evaluated in the morning by \r\npsychiatry and after further discussion was deemed to have \r\ncapacity regarding her plan of care. The patient was instructed \r\nregarding risks of alcohol withdrawal and referred to substance \r\nabuse treatment by psychiatry which she declined.\r\n\r\n# ___ metabolic acidosis: Resolved. Most likely due to \r\nlactic acidosis on presentation\r\n\r\n# Equivocal Serum HCG: Patient denied possibility of pregnancy. \r\nUrine hCG was negative. Patient with IUD in place with plans for \r\noutpatient removal.\r\n\r\n====================\r\nCHRONIC ISSUES\r\n====================\r\n# Hypothyroidism: Patient continued Levothyroxine Sodium 62.5 \r\nmcg PO DAILY. \r\n\r\n# Hx of wet beri beri: Furosemide was held in the setting of \r\nseptic shock and held on discharge given no evidence of volume \r\noverload and soft pressures.\r\n\r\n# HTN: Home Hydrochlorothiazide held as well given infection and \r\nsoft pressures as well. \r\n\r\n# Gout: Patient restarted on home allopurinol. \r\n\r\n====================\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\r\n==================== \r\n- Please continue PO Ciprofloxacin through ___ (___)\r\n- Patient will need pap smear as outpatient for further \r\nevaluation of high risk HPV in setting of bacteremia, anemia, \r\nand thrombosis\r\n- Please discuss with PCP the need for restarting furosemide as \r\nan outpatient.\r\n- Patient will need removal of IUD\r\n- Patient will need removal of IVC filter in future - please \r\ndiscuss with PCP\r\n- ___ obtain CBC and Chem 10 at next PCP appointment for \r\nevaluation of anemia and Creatinine given ___ on CKD\r\n \r\nMedications on Admission:\r\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\r\n1.

Significant improvement in hepatic steatosis. \r\n\r\nCT CHEST W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___  \r\nNormal Chest CT. No evidence of active intrathoracic infection \r\nor malignancy.  Right lower lobe opacity described on recent CT \r\nhas almost completely resolved consistent with resolving \r\natelectasis \r\n \r\nBrief Hospital Course:\r\nMs. ___ is a ___ w/ PMH of EtOH abuse (currently still \r\ndrinking) c/b EtOH hepatitis, Wernicke's encephalopathy, \r\nhypotension likely due to autonomic neuropathy; hypothyroidism, \r\nhypertension, Hx of bariatric surgery, and other issues who was \r\nsent to the ED with hypotension and bandemia concerning for \r\npancreatitis.\r\n\r\n#Septic shock: Patient presented with abdominal pain and fever, \r\nwas found to have hypotension requiring IVF resuscitation and \r\nlevophed for which she had a R IJ CVL placed. She was \r\nsubsequently found to have GNR bacteremia which speciated to pan \r\nsensitive klebsiella in ___ bottles. She was initialy treated \r\nwith broad spectrum antibiotics with IV Vancomycin/Zosyn which \r\nwas narrowed to PO Ciprolfoxacin on discharge. Her blood \r\npressure gradually increased and patient was off levophed with \r\noverall improvement of her symptoms. The etiology of the \r\nbacteremia as thought likely to be intrabdominal given pain and \r\nfurther findings described below in # abdominal pain. The \r\ndifferential also included pelvic process given adnexal \r\ntenderness on physical exam. Urinary etiologies were on the \r\ndifferential, though no urine culture prior to antibiosis \r\nobtained. The patient had previous hematoma evacuation of right \r\nthigh though wound appeared intact without evidence of \r\ninfection. Of note the patient had a history of high risk HPV \r\nwith ASCUS and there was concern that cervical etiologies could \r\nbe the source of infection, particularly concerning for \r\nmalignancy in the setting of her anemia and recent thrombosis as \r\nwell. The patient understood the need for outpatient follow up \r\nwith pap smear and IUD removal, and this was relayed to the \r\npatient's PCP as well. There were no other appreciate sources of \r\ninfection on non contrast (in setting ___ on CKD) scans of \r\nthe chest, abdomen and pelvis. The patient remained afebrile and \r\nhemodynamically stable after transfer to the medicine floor from \r\nthe MICU.\r\n\r\n# Abdominal pain: Patient presented with abdominal pain and \r\nfever, was found to have GNR bacteremia speciated to pan \r\nsensitive klebsiella as above. In terms of source of infection, \r\nRUQ ultrasound was without evidence of cholecystitis or CBD \r\ndilatation and CT chest/abdomen was not notable for any \r\nabnormalities that could explain the symptoms. Elevated lipase \r\nwith elevated LFTs was suggestive of pancreatitis; however, her \r\npain was not entirely typical (not prominent in epigastrium) and \r\nCT abdomen did not show signs of pancrteatitis. \r\nCholedocholithiasis with a passed stone was thought to be a \r\npossibility as well given the downtrending LFTS. The \r\ndifferential also included pelvic etiology, though patient \r\ndenied any urinary or vaginal symptoms. The patient's pain \r\nimproved thoughout the admission and the patient was tolerating \r\nPO well on discharge.  \r\n\r\n# Pancreatitis: Patient with lipase >3X ULN and abdominal pain \r\n(though somewhat atypical), however no evidence of pancreatitis \r\non CT (though non contrast given ___ on CKD). Differential \r\nincluded EtOH given history of heavy drinking, biliary sources \r\ngiven elevated LFTs on admission as well. However lipase may \r\nalso have been elevated for alternate etiologies in the setting \r\nof possible GI infection and may not have been representative of \r\ntrue pancreatitis. As above the patient's pain improved \r\nthroughout the admission and was tolerating PO well on \r\ndischarge. \r\n\r\n# Transaminitis: The differential included biliary infection, \r\nhowever  RUQ US without cholecystitis or biliary dilatation, vs. \r\ncholedochlithiasis with passed stone. Could consider \r\ncontribution from heavy EtOH as well, though ration of ALT/AST \r\nless suggestive of this etiology. The patient's LFTs improved \r\nthroughout the hospital course, and T bili normalized. \r\n\r\n# ___: Patient was recently discontinued from \r\nhemodialysis in the past month, as her renal function has \r\nrecovered from a prior ATN. Cr was elevated on admission to 3.3. \r\nShe received fluid and her creatinine gradually decreased. \r\nCreatinine on discharge was 1.8.\r\n\r\n# Anemia: Patient with chronic anemia extensively worked up in \r\nthe past. No evidence of current hemolysis given normalized T \r\nbili. Likely component of hemoconcentration on admission in the \r\nsetting of septic shock. Differential included infection and \r\nmedication (Zosyn) causing bone marrow suppression, as well as \r\nheavy EtOh use. The patient did not require any blood \r\ntransfusions during the admission.\r\n\r\n# EtOH abuse: Patient reported drinking ___ to 1 pint of hard \r\nliquor per day, with her last drink being the day before \r\nadmission. She was placed on CIWA scale, and treated with \r\nmultivitamins and thiamine. The patient attempted to leave AMA \r\nthe day prior to discharge and was evaluated by psychiatry \r\novernight who were concerned that the patient lacked capacity to \r\nat that time. The patient as re evaluated in the morning by \r\npsychiatry and after further discussion was deemed to have \r\ncapacity regarding her plan of care. The patient was instructed \r\nregarding risks of alcohol withdrawal and referred to substance \r\nabuse treatment by psychiatry which she declined.\r\n\r\n# ___ metabolic acidosis: Resolved. Most likely due to \r\nlactic acidosis on presentation\r\n\r\n# Equivocal Serum HCG: Patient denied possibility of pregnancy. \r\nUrine hCG was negative. Patient with IUD in place with plans for \r\noutpatient removal.\r\n\r\n====================\r\nCHRONIC ISSUES\r\n====================\r\n# Hypothyroidism: Patient continued Levothyroxine Sodium 62.5 \r\nmcg PO DAILY. \r\n\r\n# Hx of wet beri beri: Furosemide was held in the setting of \r\nseptic shock and held on discharge given no evidence of volume \r\noverload and soft pressures.\r\n\r\n# HTN: Home Hydrochlorothiazide held as well given infection and \r\nsoft pressures as well. \r\n\r\n# Gout: Patient restarted on home allopurinol. \r\n\r\n====================\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\r\n==================== \r\n- Please continue PO Ciprofloxacin through ___ (___)\r\n- Patient will need pap smear as outpatient for further \r\nevaluation of high risk HPV in setting of bacteremia, anemia, \r\nand thrombosis\r\n- Please discuss with PCP the need for restarting furosemide as \r\nan outpatient.\r\n- Patient will need removal of IUD\r\n- Patient will need removal of IVC filter in future - please \r\ndiscuss with PCP\r\n- ___ obtain CBC and Chem 10 at next PCP appointment for \r\nevaluation of anemia and Creatinine given ___ on CKD\r\n \r\nMedications on Admission:\r\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\r\n1.

Significant improvement in hepatic steatosis. \r\n\r\nCT CHEST W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___  \r\nNormal Chest CT. No evidence of active intrathoracic infection \r\nor malignancy.  Right lower lobe opacity described on recent CT \r\nhas almost completely resolved consistent with resolving \r\natelectasis \r\n \r\nBrief Hospital Course:\r\nMs. ___ is a ___ w/ PMH of EtOH abuse (currently still \r\ndrinking) c/b EtOH hepatitis, Wernicke's encephalopathy, \r\nhypotension likely due to autonomic neuropathy; hypothyroidism, \r\nhypertension, Hx of bariatric surgery, and other issues who was \r\nsent to the ED with hypotension and bandemia concerning for \r\npancreatitis.\r\n\r\n#Septic shock: Patient presented with abdominal pain and fever, \r\nwas found to have hypotension requiring IVF resuscitation and \r\nlevophed for which she had a R IJ CVL placed. She was \r\nsubsequently found to have GNR bacteremia which speciated to pan \r\nsensitive klebsiella in ___ bottles. She was initialy treated \r\nwith broad spectrum antibiotics with IV Vancomycin/Zosyn which \r\nwas narrowed to PO Ciprolfoxacin on discharge. Her blood \r\npressure gradually increased and patient was off levophed with \r\noverall improvement of her symptoms. The etiology of the \r\nbacteremia as thought likely to be intrabdominal given pain and \r\nfurther findings described below in # abdominal pain. The \r\ndifferential also included pelvic process given adnexal \r\ntenderness on physical exam. Urinary etiologies were on the \r\ndifferential, though no urine culture prior to antibiosis \r\nobtained. The patient had previous hematoma evacuation of right \r\nthigh though wound appeared intact without evidence of \r\ninfection. Of note the patient had a history of high risk HPV \r\nwith ASCUS and there was concern that cervical etiologies could \r\nbe the source of infection, particularly concerning for \r\nmalignancy in the setting of her anemia and recent thrombosis as \r\nwell. The patient understood the need for outpatient follow up \r\nwith pap smear and IUD removal, and this was relayed to the \r\npatient's PCP as well. There were no other appreciate sources of \r\ninfection on non contrast (in setting ___ on CKD) scans of \r\nthe chest, abdomen and pelvis. The patient remained afebrile and \r\nhemodynamically stable after transfer to the medicine floor from \r\nthe MICU.\r\n\r\n# Abdominal pain: Patient presented with abdominal pain and \r\nfever, was found to have GNR bacteremia speciated to pan \r\nsensitive klebsiella as above. In terms of source of infection, \r\nRUQ ultrasound was without evidence of cholecystitis or CBD \r\ndilatation and CT chest/abdomen was not notable for any \r\nabnormalities that could explain the symptoms. Elevated lipase \r\nwith elevated LFTs was suggestive of pancreatitis; however, her \r\npain was not entirely typical (not prominent in epigastrium) and \r\nCT abdomen did not show signs of pancrteatitis. \r\nCholedocholithiasis with a passed stone was thought to be a \r\npossibility as well given the downtrending LFTS. The \r\ndifferential also included pelvic etiology, though patient \r\ndenied any urinary or vaginal symptoms. The patient's pain \r\nimproved thoughout the admission and the patient was tolerating \r\nPO well on discharge.  \r\n\r\n# Pancreatitis: Patient with lipase >3X ULN and abdominal pain \r\n(though somewhat atypical), however no evidence of pancreatitis \r\non CT (though non contrast given ___ on CKD). Differential \r\nincluded EtOH given history of heavy drinking, biliary sources \r\ngiven elevated LFTs on admission as well. However lipase may \r\nalso have been elevated for alternate etiologies in the setting \r\nof possible GI infection and may not have been representative of \r\ntrue pancreatitis. As above the patient's pain improved \r\nthroughout the admission and was tolerating PO well on \r\ndischarge. \r\n\r\n# Transaminitis: The differential included biliary infection, \r\nhowever  RUQ US without cholecystitis or biliary dilatation, vs. \r\ncholedochlithiasis with passed stone. Could consider \r\ncontribution from heavy EtOH as well, though ration of ALT/AST \r\nless suggestive of this etiology. The patient's LFTs improved \r\nthroughout the hospital course, and T bili normalized. \r\n\r\n# ___: Patient was recently discontinued from \r\nhemodialysis in the past month, as her renal function has \r\nrecovered from a prior ATN. Cr was elevated on admission to 3.3. \r\nShe received fluid and her creatinine gradually decreased. \r\nCreatinine on discharge was 1.8.\r\n\r\n# Anemia: Patient with chronic anemia extensively worked up in \r\nthe past. No evidence of current hemolysis given normalized T \r\nbili. Likely component of hemoconcentration on admission in the \r\nsetting of septic shock. Differential included infection and \r\nmedication (Zosyn) causing bone marrow suppression, as well as \r\nheavy EtOh use. The patient did not require any blood \r\ntransfusions during the admission.\r\n\r\n# EtOH abuse: Patient reported drinking ___ to 1 pint of hard \r\nliquor per day, with her last drink being the day before \r\nadmission. She was placed on CIWA scale, and treated with \r\nmultivitamins and thiamine. The patient attempted to leave AMA \r\nthe day prior to discharge and was evaluated by psychiatry \r\novernight who were concerned that the patient lacked capacity to \r\nat that time. The patient as re evaluated in the morning by \r\npsychiatry and after further discussion was deemed to have \r\ncapacity regarding her plan of care. The patient was instructed \r\nregarding risks of alcohol withdrawal and referred to substance \r\nabuse treatment by psychiatry which she declined.\r\n\r\n# ___ metabolic acidosis: Resolved. Most likely due to \r\nlactic acidosis on presentation\r\n\r\n# Equivocal Serum HCG: Patient denied possibility of pregnancy. \r\nUrine hCG was negative. Patient with IUD in place with plans for \r\noutpatient removal.\r\n\r\n====================\r\nCHRONIC ISSUES\r\n====================\r\n# Hypothyroidism: Patient continued Levothyroxine Sodium 62.5 \r\nmcg PO DAILY. \r\n\r\n# Hx of wet beri beri: Furosemide was held in the setting of \r\nseptic shock and held on discharge given no evidence of volume \r\noverload and soft pressures.\r\n\r\n# HTN: Home Hydrochlorothiazide held as well given infection and \r\nsoft pressures as well. \r\n\r\n# Gout: Patient restarted on home allopurinol. \r\n\r\n====================\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\r\n==================== \r\n- Please continue PO Ciprofloxacin through ___ (___)\r\n- Patient will need pap smear as outpatient for further \r\nevaluation of high risk HPV in setting of bacteremia, anemia, \r\nand thrombosis\r\n- Please discuss with PCP the need for restarting furosemide as \r\nan outpatient.\r\n- Patient will need removal of IUD\r\n- Patient will need removal of IVC filter in future - please \r\ndiscuss with PCP\r\n- ___ obtain CBC and Chem 10 at next PCP appointment for \r\nevaluation of anemia and Creatinine given ___ on CKD\r\n \r\nMedications on Admission:\r\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\r\n1.

The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within \r\nnormal \r\nlimits.  No acute osseous abnormalities.  IVC filter is \r\npartially visualized.   \r\nIMPRESSION:    \r\nNo acute cardiopulmonary process. \r\n\r\nCT A/P (___): \r\nIMPRESSION:   \r\n1. Mildly limited exam without oral or IV contrast.  No \r\nabnormality identified to explain the patient's left lower \r\nquadrant abdominal pain. \r\n2. Post gastric bypass surgery without evidence of obstruction. \r\n\r\nMICROBIOLOGY\r\n___: Urine culture negative, blood cultures pending\r\n \r\nBrief Hospital Course:\r\nMs. ___ is a ___ woman with a history of ETOH abuse, \r\nhypotension likely ___ autonomic instability, and recent ATN \r\nrequiring temporary hemodialysis who was admitted for elevated \r\nCr.\r\n \r\n#AoCKD, stage 3B: On initial presentation, her Cr was elevated \r\nto 3.9. Urine electrolytes were notable for FeNa of 2.6, \r\nconcerning for possible ischemic ATN in the setting of her \r\nhypotension (see below). However, her Cr improved each day s/p \r\nIVF and was 2.3 at discharge (baseline ~1.8) which was \r\nreassuring. No known recent nephrotoxic drugs to raise concern \r\nfor toxic ATN, though she may have been taking ibuprofen (she \r\ncouldn't remember which pain reliever she has). She endorsed \r\nleft flank pain, but this was chronic and she had no hematuria \r\nor dysuria to raise concern for nephrolithiasis or other \r\nobstruction. She continued to make appropriate volumes of urine \r\nand CT abdomen showed no hydronephrosis, which was reassuring \r\nagainst a post-renal process. \r\n\r\n#Hypotension: On initial presentation, she had systolic blood \r\npressures in the ___ in ED, which improved to 117/69 with IV \r\nfluids. Her systolic blood pressures remained 100s-110s \r\nthroughout admission. The cause of her initial hypotension is \r\nunclear. The most likely etiology is her known autonomic \r\ninstability v. poor PO intake that the patient endorsed. Her AM \r\ncortisol was within an indeterminate range. She was afebrile \r\nwith normal heart rates and no leukocytosis, so sepsis was \r\nunlikely. She denied chest pain, EKG without e/o ischemia or \r\narrhythmia, and trop negative, so cardiac cause is unlikely. \r\nPatient denied history of vomiting/diarrhea to cause \r\nhypovolemia. She does endorse increased frequency and volume of \r\nurination, though seems unlikely that this would be significant \r\nenough to cause hypotension to the ___.     \r\n\r\n#Anemia - Patient with stable macrocytic anemia (Hb 7.9-8.7) \r\nwith elevated RDW and low MCHC, consistent with baseline. Her \r\nferritin is elevated to 3080, TIBC is low, and transferrin \r\nsaturation is 65%, likely consistent with anemia of chronic \r\ninflammation. She reports recent weight loss. Notably, she had \r\nnegative HIV test in ___. She may also have bone marrow \r\nsuppression from alcohol use. B12 and iron levels are wnl. In \r\nthe setting of CKD, she may have reduced EPO production. Lastly, \r\ngiven anemia and kidney disease, multiple myeloma is on the \r\ndifferential. Her total protein is elevated and SPEP is pending. \r\nNotably, her calcium level is normal and she denies bone pain.  \r\n\r\n#ETOH dependence: Reports drinking a pint of brandy daily, with \r\nlast drink 6pm the night before admission. Throughout her stay, \r\nshe denied shakiness or symptoms concerning for withdrawal, with \r\nstable CIWA of 1 for nausea. \r\n \r\n#Transaminitis: AST/ALT were mildly elevated on admission but \r\nwere down-trending. INR was 1.0 and platelets within normal \r\nlimits, indicating good synthetic function of liver. History and \r\nAST > ALT both argue for EtoH hepatitis. CT scan without \r\nevidence of ascites.  \r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n=====================\r\n[ ] Patient should have chemistry panel drawn on ___ and \r\nfaxed to ___'s office (to ensure resolution of ___.\r\n[ ] Patient encouraged to monitor BPs at home.\r\n[ ] Pending labs: SPEP, UPEP.\r\n[ ] Given indeterminate AM cortisol, consider ACTH stimulation \r\ntest if concern for adrenal insufficiency is high.\r\n[ ] Patient should not take HCTZ, lisinopril, or any other \r\npotentially nephrotoxic medication.\r\n[ ] Of note, lactate elevated on discharge despite normal BP. \r\nThought to be secondary to poor clearance in the setting of \r\nchronic liver disease.\r\n[ ] Ferritin 3000, consistent with anemia of chronic disease. \r\nPatient reported anorexia and weight loss. Consider further \r\nwork-up as outpatient.\r\n\r\n \r\nMedications on Admission:\r\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\r\n1. Acetaminophen 650 mg PO Q8H:PRN pain \r\n2.

Your blood tests also showed that your \r\nkidney function was improving after getting more fluid. \r\n\r\nWhen you go home, you should try to drink fluids to help your \r\nblood pressure and kidneys. You should NOT take your lisinopril \r\nbecause this can cause low blood pressure and kidney damange. \r\nYou also mentioned that you have taken hydrochlorothiazide in \r\nthe past. You should NOT take this medicine because it can cause \r\nlow blood pressures and can damage your kidneys more. \r\n\r\nPlease keep the follow up appointment with your primary care \r\nphysician on ___, see below). You should have repeat \r\nblood work done on ___ to ensure that your kidney \r\nfunction is back to normal.\r\n\r\nPlease monitor your blood pressure periodically at home. You can \r\nbuy a blood pressure cuff or check your blood pressure at a \r\ndrugstore ___, ___, etc). Please bring a lot of your \r\nblood pressure to your primary care physician.\r\n\r\nIt was a pleasure to participate in your care. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nYour ___ team\r\n \r\nFollowup Instructions:\r\n___\r\n"

Urine electrolytes were notable for FeNa of 2.6, \r\nconcerning for possible ischemic ATN in the setting of her \r\nhypotension (see below). However, her Cr improved each day s/p \r\nIVF and was 2.3 at discharge (baseline ~1.8) which was \r\nreassuring. No known recent nephrotoxic drugs to raise concern \r\nfor toxic ATN, though she may have been taking ibuprofen (she \r\ncouldn't remember which pain reliever she has). She endorsed \r\nleft flank pain, but this was chronic and she had no hematuria \r\nor dysuria to raise concern for nephrolithiasis or other \r\nobstruction. She continued to make appropriate volumes of urine \r\nand CT abdomen showed no hydronephrosis, which was reassuring \r\nagainst a post-renal process. \r\n\r\n#Hypotension: On initial presentation, she had systolic blood \r\npressures in the ___ in ED, which improved to 117/69 with IV \r\nfluids. Her systolic blood pressures remained 100s-110s \r\nthroughout admission. The cause of her initial hypotension is \r\nunclear. The most likely etiology is her known autonomic \r\ninstability v. poor PO intake that the patient endorsed. Her AM \r\ncortisol was within an indeterminate range. She was afebrile \r\nwith normal heart rates and no leukocytosis, so sepsis was \r\nunlikely. She denied chest pain, EKG without e/o ischemia or \r\narrhythmia, and trop negative, so cardiac cause is unlikely. \r\nPatient denied history of vomiting/diarrhea to cause \r\nhypovolemia. She does endorse increased frequency and volume of \r\nurination, though seems unlikely that this would be significant \r\nenough to cause hypotension to the ___.     \r\n\r\n#Anemia - Patient with stable macrocytic anemia (Hb 7.9-8.7) \r\nwith elevated RDW and low MCHC, consistent with baseline. Her \r\nferritin is elevated to 3080, TIBC is low, and transferrin \r\nsaturation is 65%, likely consistent with anemia of chronic \r\ninflammation. She reports recent weight loss. Notably, she had \r\nnegative HIV test in ___. She may also have bone marrow \r\nsuppression from alcohol use. B12 and iron levels are wnl. In \r\nthe setting of CKD, she may have reduced EPO production. Lastly, \r\ngiven anemia and kidney disease, multiple myeloma is on the \r\ndifferential. Her total protein is elevated and SPEP is pending. \r\nNotably, her calcium level is normal and she denies bone pain.  \r\n\r\n#ETOH dependence: Reports drinking a pint of brandy daily, with \r\nlast drink 6pm the night before admission. Throughout her stay, \r\nshe denied shakiness or symptoms concerning for withdrawal, with \r\nstable CIWA of 1 for nausea. \r\n \r\n#Transaminitis: AST/ALT were mildly elevated on admission but \r\nwere down-trending. INR was 1.0 and platelets within normal \r\nlimits, indicating good synthetic function of liver. History and \r\nAST > ALT both argue for EtoH hepatitis.

She continued to make appropriate volumes of urine \nand CT abdomen showed no hydronephrosis, which was reassuring \nagainst a post-renal process. #Hypotension: On initial presentation, she had systolic blood \npressures in the ___ in ED, which improved to 117/69 with IV \nfluids. Her systolic blood pressures remained 100s-110s \nthroughout admission. The cause of her initial hypotension is \nunclear.

She was afebrile \nwith normal heart rates and no leukocytosis, so sepsis was \nunlikely. She denied chest pain, EKG without e/o ischemia or \narrhythmia, and trop negative, so cardiac cause is unlikely. Patient denied history of vomiting/diarrhea to cause \nhypovolemia. She does endorse increased frequency and volume of \nurination, though seems unlikely that this would be significant \nenough to cause hypotension to the ___. #Anemia - Patient with stable macrocytic anemia (Hb 7.9-8.7) \nwith elevated RDW and low MCHC, consistent with baseline. Her \nferritin is elevated to 3080, TIBC is low, and transferrin \nsaturation is 65%, likely consistent with anemia of chronic \ninflammation. She reports recent weight loss. Notably, she had \nnegative HIV test in ___. She may also have bone marrow \nsuppression from alcohol use. B12 and iron levels are wnl. In \nthe setting of CKD, she may have reduced EPO production. Lastly, \ngiven anemia and kidney disease, multiple myeloma is on the \ndifferential. Her total protein is elevated and SPEP is pending. Notably, her calcium level is normal and she denies bone pain. #ETOH dependence: Reports drinking a pint of brandy daily, with \nlast drink 6pm the night before admission. Throughout her stay, \nshe denied shakiness or symptoms concerning for withdrawal, with \nstable CIWA of 1 for nausea.",

Post gastric bypass surgery without evidence of obstruction. \r\n\r\nMICROBIOLOGY\r\n___: Urine culture negative, blood cultures pending\r\n \r\nBrief Hospital Course:\r\nMs. ___ is a ___ woman with a history of ETOH abuse, \r\nhypotension likely ___ autonomic instability, and recent ATN \r\nrequiring temporary hemodialysis who was admitted for elevated \r\nCr.\r\n \r\n#AoCKD, stage 3B: On initial presentation, her Cr was elevated \r\nto 3.9. Urine electrolytes were notable for FeNa of 2.6, \r\nconcerning for possible ischemic ATN in the setting of her \r\nhypotension (see below). However, her Cr improved each day s/p \r\nIVF and was 2.3 at discharge (baseline ~1.8) which was \r\nreassuring. No known recent nephrotoxic drugs to raise concern \r\nfor toxic ATN, though she may have been taking ibuprofen (she \r\ncouldn't remember which pain reliever she has). She endorsed \r\nleft flank pain, but this was chronic and she had no hematuria \r\nor dysuria to raise concern for nephrolithiasis or other \r\nobstruction. She continued to make appropriate volumes of urine \r\nand CT abdomen showed no hydronephrosis, which was reassuring \r\nagainst a post-renal process. \r\n\r\n#Hypotension: On initial presentation, she had systolic blood \r\npressures in the ___ in ED, which improved to 117/69 with IV \r\nfluids. Her systolic blood pressures remained 100s-110s \r\nthroughout admission. The cause of her initial hypotension is \r\nunclear. The most likely etiology is her known autonomic \r\ninstability v. poor PO intake that the patient endorsed. Her AM \r\ncortisol was within an indeterminate range. She was afebrile \r\nwith normal heart rates and no leukocytosis, so sepsis was \r\nunlikely. She denied chest pain, EKG without e/o ischemia or \r\narrhythmia, and trop negative, so cardiac cause is unlikely. \r\nPatient denied history of vomiting/diarrhea to cause \r\nhypovolemia. She does endorse increased frequency and volume of \r\nurination, though seems unlikely that this would be significant \r\nenough to cause hypotension to the ___.     \r\n\r\n#Anemia - Patient with stable macrocytic anemia (Hb 7.9-8.7) \r\nwith elevated RDW and low MCHC, consistent with baseline. Her \r\nferritin is elevated to 3080, TIBC is low, and transferrin \r\nsaturation is 65%, likely consistent with anemia of chronic \r\ninflammation. She reports recent weight loss. Notably, she had \r\nnegative HIV test in ___. She may also have bone marrow \r\nsuppression from alcohol use. B12 and iron levels are wnl. In \r\nthe setting of CKD, she may have reduced EPO production. Lastly, \r\ngiven anemia and kidney disease, multiple myeloma is on the \r\ndifferential. Her total protein is elevated and SPEP is pending. \r\nNotably, her calcium level is normal and she denies bone pain.  \r\n\r\n#ETOH dependence: Reports drinking a pint of brandy daily, with \r\nlast drink 6pm the night before admission. Throughout her stay, \r\nshe denied shakiness or symptoms concerning for withdrawal, with \r\nstable CIWA of 1 for nausea. \r\n \r\n#Transaminitis: AST/ALT were mildly elevated on admission but \r\nwere down-trending. INR was 1.0 and platelets within normal \r\nlimits, indicating good synthetic function of liver. History and \r\nAST > ALT both argue for EtoH hepatitis. CT scan without \r\nevidence of ascites.  \r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n=====================\r\n[ ] Patient should have chemistry panel drawn on ___ and \r\nfaxed to ___'s office (to ensure resolution of ___.\r\n[ ] Patient encouraged to monitor BPs at home.\r\n[ ] Pending labs: SPEP, UPEP.\r\n[ ] Given indeterminate AM cortisol, consider ACTH stimulation \r\ntest if concern for adrenal insufficiency is high.\r\n[ ] Patient should not take HCTZ, lisinopril, or any other \r\npotentially nephrotoxic medication.\r\n[ ] Of note, lactate elevated on discharge despite normal BP. \r\nThought to be secondary to poor clearance in the setting of \r\nchronic liver disease.\r\n[ ] Ferritin 3000, consistent with anemia of chronic disease. \r\nPatient reported anorexia and weight loss.

The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within \r\nnormal \r\nlimits.  No acute osseous abnormalities.  IVC filter is \r\npartially visualized.   \r\nIMPRESSION:    \r\nNo acute cardiopulmonary process. \r\n\r\nCT A/P (___): \r\nIMPRESSION:   \r\n1. Mildly limited exam without oral or IV contrast.  No \r\nabnormality identified to explain the patient's left lower \r\nquadrant abdominal pain. \r\n2. Post gastric bypass surgery without evidence of obstruction. \r\n\r\nMICROBIOLOGY\r\n___: Urine culture negative, blood cultures pending\r\n \r\nBrief Hospital Course:\r\nMs. ___ is a ___ woman with a history of ETOH abuse, \r\nhypotension likely ___ autonomic instability, and recent ATN \r\nrequiring temporary hemodialysis who was admitted for elevated \r\nCr.\r\n \r\n#AoCKD, stage 3B: On initial presentation, her Cr was elevated \r\nto 3.9. Urine electrolytes were notable for FeNa of 2.6, \r\nconcerning for possible ischemic ATN in the setting of her \r\nhypotension (see below). However, her Cr improved each day s/p \r\nIVF and was 2.3 at discharge (baseline ~1.8) which was \r\nreassuring. No known recent nephrotoxic drugs to raise concern \r\nfor toxic ATN, though she may have been taking ibuprofen (she \r\ncouldn't remember which pain reliever she has). She endorsed \r\nleft flank pain, but this was chronic and she had no hematuria \r\nor dysuria to raise concern for nephrolithiasis or other \r\nobstruction. She continued to make appropriate volumes of urine \r\nand CT abdomen showed no hydronephrosis, which was reassuring \r\nagainst a post-renal process. \r\n\r\n#Hypotension: On initial presentation, she had systolic blood \r\npressures in the ___ in ED, which improved to 117/69 with IV \r\nfluids. Her systolic blood pressures remained 100s-110s \r\nthroughout admission. The cause of her initial hypotension is \r\nunclear. The most likely etiology is her known autonomic \r\ninstability v. poor PO intake that the patient endorsed. Her AM \r\ncortisol was within an indeterminate range. She was afebrile \r\nwith normal heart rates and no leukocytosis, so sepsis was \r\nunlikely. She denied chest pain, EKG without e/o ischemia or \r\narrhythmia, and trop negative, so cardiac cause is unlikely. \r\nPatient denied history of vomiting/diarrhea to cause \r\nhypovolemia. She does endorse increased frequency and volume of \r\nurination, though seems unlikely that this would be significant \r\nenough to cause hypotension to the ___.     \r\n\r\n#Anemia - Patient with stable macrocytic anemia (Hb 7.9-8.7) \r\nwith elevated RDW and low MCHC, consistent with baseline. Her \r\nferritin is elevated to 3080, TIBC is low, and transferrin \r\nsaturation is 65%, likely consistent with anemia of chronic \r\ninflammation. She reports recent weight loss. Notably, she had \r\nnegative HIV test in ___. She may also have bone marrow \r\nsuppression from alcohol use. B12 and iron levels are wnl. In \r\nthe setting of CKD, she may have reduced EPO production. Lastly, \r\ngiven anemia and kidney disease, multiple myeloma is on the \r\ndifferential. Her total protein is elevated and SPEP is pending. \r\nNotably, her calcium level is normal and she denies bone pain.  \r\n\r\n#ETOH dependence: Reports drinking a pint of brandy daily, with \r\nlast drink 6pm the night before admission. Throughout her stay, \r\nshe denied shakiness or symptoms concerning for withdrawal, with \r\nstable CIWA of 1 for nausea. \r\n \r\n#Transaminitis: AST/ALT were mildly elevated on admission but \r\nwere down-trending. INR was 1.0 and platelets within normal \r\nlimits, indicating good synthetic function of liver. History and \r\nAST > ALT both argue for EtoH hepatitis. CT scan without \r\nevidence of ascites.  \r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n=====================\r\n[ ] Patient should have chemistry panel drawn on ___ and \r\nfaxed to ___'s office (to ensure resolution of ___.\r\n[ ] Patient encouraged to monitor BPs at home.\r\n[ ] Pending labs: SPEP, UPEP.\r\n[ ] Given indeterminate AM cortisol, consider ACTH stimulation \r\ntest if concern for adrenal insufficiency is high.\r\n[ ] Patient should not take HCTZ, lisinopril, or any other \r\npotentially nephrotoxic medication.\r\n[ ] Of note, lactate elevated on discharge despite normal BP. \r\nThought to be secondary to poor clearance in the setting of \r\nchronic liver disease.\r\n[ ] Ferritin 3000, consistent with anemia of chronic disease. \r\nPatient reported anorexia and weight loss.

She had variceal banding and was noted to have a \r\nlarge ulcer on EGD while in the ICU, these were considered to be \r\nthe source of her bleeding, and she was medically optimized to \r\nprevent re-bleeding following the EGD on the ET service. She \r\nremained stable once out of the ICU, received HD, and was \r\ndischarged home in stable condition.\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n==================\r\n[ ] Complex cyst in the midpole of the right kidney, likely a \r\nhemorrahgic cyst. Recommend follow up in 6 months to assess for \r\ninterval change. \r\n[ ] Unable to start BB inpatient due to low BPs (and patient is \r\non high dose midodrine). If able to tolerate, please start BB \r\ngiven her varices. \r\n[ ] Requires a follow-up EGD in ___. \r\n[ ] 6 weeks of BID PPI, then recommend taper down to once daily. \r\n\r\n[ ] 2 weeks carafate due to recent banding. \r\n[ ] Recommend referral by PCP to outpatient/inpatient treatment \r\nfor alcohol use disorder if patient is amenable. \r\n[ ] Patient discharged with home ___ and ___. \r\n\r\nCODE STATUS: Full\r\nCONTACT: ___, ___\r\n\r\nACUTE ISSUES:\r\n============\r\n#Acute blood loss anemia ___ upper GI bleed, likely ___ large \r\nmarginal ulcer versus variceal bleeding \r\nThe patient presented from HD due to shortness of breath \r\nbelieved to be ___ pulmonary edema from a previously missed HD \r\nsession. Upon presentation to the ED, she was noted to have \r\nmelena and her Hb was 5, and she was transferred to the ICU. She \r\nrequired 3u pRBCs while there. She had an EGD which showed one \r\ngrade 3 varix in the distal esophagus with stigmata of recent \r\nbleeding s/p ligation, and at the RNY gastrojejunostomy \r\nencountered a large marginal ulcer with white mucous plug at \r\nanastomosis and no evidence of active bleeding. Following her \r\nEGD, she was transferred to ET and placed on high dose PPI, \r\ncarafate BID (reduced given renal dysfunction), ceftriaxone 1g \r\nIV for SBP prophylaxis. Octreotide drip was discontinued. Due to \r\nher low blood pressures she is unable to tolerate nadolol. She \r\nwas discharged with Hgb 7.3.\r\n\r\n#Alcoholic cirrhosis c/b hepatic encephalopathy\r\nThe patient described an extensive history of alcohol use, \r\nincluding up to the day prior to her admission. On presentation \r\nshe had asterixis on her exam and was noted to be somnolent. She \r\nwas given lactulose TID and part of her encephalopathy was \r\npresumed related to uremia from missing HD; this was treated on \r\nher ___ HD session. Her bleeding was treated as above, and \r\nshe was noted to have abdominal discomfort on exam, confirmed by \r\nmoderate ascites on CT exam. She will require continued \r\nmonitoring of GI bleed risk, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy \r\nas an outpatient, especially in the setting of continued alcohol \r\nuse.\r\n\r\n#Alcohol use disorder. Discharged from rehab for alcohol \r\ndisorder a few weeks ago, but described her last drink as \r\nmidnight the night prior to presentation to the ED. She was \r\nreported to be somnolent in the ED.

On multiple occasions the team discussed \r\nwith her the importance of stopping alcohol. We spoke to her \r\nmother on the day of discharge and instructed her to discard all \r\nalcohol from the home prior to discharge. \r\n\r\n#Peripheral edema. She had lower extremity swelling (R>L) and as \r\na result had a lower extremity doppler ultrasound that showed no \r\nevidence of clot. The patient described this as a chronic issue \r\nfor her, no further work-up was completed.\r\n\r\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\r\n==============\r\n#ESRD on HD\r\n#Anion gap metabolic acidosis.

She had variceal banding and was noted to have a \r\nlarge ulcer on EGD while in the ICU, these were considered to be \r\nthe source of her bleeding, and she was medically optimized to \r\nprevent re-bleeding following the EGD on the ET service. She \r\nremained stable once out of the ICU, received HD, and was \r\ndischarged home in stable condition.\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n==================\r\n[ ] Complex cyst in the midpole of the right kidney, likely a \r\nhemorrahgic cyst. Recommend follow up in 6 months to assess for \r\ninterval change. \r\n[ ] Unable to start BB inpatient due to low BPs (and patient is \r\non high dose midodrine). If able to tolerate, please start BB \r\ngiven her varices. \r\n[ ] Requires a follow-up EGD in ___. \r\n[ ] 6 weeks of BID PPI, then recommend taper down to once daily. \r\n\r\n[ ] 2 weeks carafate due to recent banding. \r\n[ ] Recommend referral by PCP to outpatient/inpatient treatment \r\nfor alcohol use disorder if patient is amenable. \r\n[ ] Patient discharged with home ___ and ___. \r\n\r\nCODE STATUS: Full\r\nCONTACT: ___, ___\r\n\r\nACUTE ISSUES:\r\n============\r\n#Acute blood loss anemia ___ upper GI bleed, likely ___ large \r\nmarginal ulcer versus variceal bleeding \r\nThe patient presented from HD due to shortness of breath \r\nbelieved to be ___ pulmonary edema from a previously missed HD \r\nsession. Upon presentation to the ED, she was noted to have \r\nmelena and her Hb was 5, and she was transferred to the ICU. She \r\nrequired 3u pRBCs while there. She had an EGD which showed one \r\ngrade 3 varix in the distal esophagus with stigmata of recent \r\nbleeding s/p ligation, and at the RNY gastrojejunostomy \r\nencountered a large marginal ulcer with white mucous plug at \r\nanastomosis and no evidence of active bleeding. Following her \r\nEGD, she was transferred to ET and placed on high dose PPI, \r\ncarafate BID (reduced given renal dysfunction), ceftriaxone 1g \r\nIV for SBP prophylaxis. Octreotide drip was discontinued. Due to \r\nher low blood pressures she is unable to tolerate nadolol. She \r\nwas discharged with Hgb 7.3.\r\n\r\n#Alcoholic cirrhosis c/b hepatic encephalopathy\r\nThe patient described an extensive history of alcohol use, \r\nincluding up to the day prior to her admission. On presentation \r\nshe had asterixis on her exam and was noted to be somnolent. She \r\nwas given lactulose TID and part of her encephalopathy was \r\npresumed related to uremia from missing HD; this was treated on \r\nher ___ HD session. Her bleeding was treated as above, and \r\nshe was noted to have abdominal discomfort on exam, confirmed by \r\nmoderate ascites on CT exam. She will require continued \r\nmonitoring of GI bleed risk, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy \r\nas an outpatient, especially in the setting of continued alcohol \r\nuse.\r\n\r\n#Alcohol use disorder. Discharged from rehab for alcohol \r\ndisorder a few weeks ago, but described her last drink as \r\nmidnight the night prior to presentation to the ED. She was \r\nreported to be somnolent in the ED. She had no signs or symptoms \r\nof withdrawal but was placed on CIWA protocol and did not score. \r\nShe was given high dose thiamine for 3 days, folate, and social \r\nwork was consulted. On multiple occasions the team discussed \r\nwith her the importance of stopping alcohol. We spoke to her \r\nmother on the day of discharge and instructed her to discard all \r\nalcohol from the home prior to discharge. \r\n\r\n#Peripheral edema. She had lower extremity swelling (R>L) and as \r\na result had a lower extremity doppler ultrasound that showed no \r\nevidence of clot. The patient described this as a chronic issue \r\nfor her, no further work-up was completed.\r\n\r\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\r\n==============\r\n#ESRD on HD\r\n#Anion gap metabolic acidosis. Received HD while inpatient. \r\nAcidosis presumed ___ renal disease.\r\n\r\n#Chronic pancreatitis.

She had variceal banding and was noted to have a \r\nlarge ulcer on EGD while in the ICU, these were considered to be \r\nthe source of her bleeding, and she was medically optimized to \r\nprevent re-bleeding following the EGD on the ET service. She \r\nremained stable once out of the ICU, received HD, and was \r\ndischarged home in stable condition.\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n==================\r\n[ ] Complex cyst in the midpole of the right kidney, likely a \r\nhemorrahgic cyst. Recommend follow up in 6 months to assess for \r\ninterval change. \r\n[ ] Unable to start BB inpatient due to low BPs (and patient is \r\non high dose midodrine). If able to tolerate, please start BB \r\ngiven her varices. \r\n[ ] Requires a follow-up EGD in ___. \r\n[ ] 6 weeks of BID PPI, then recommend taper down to once daily. \r\n\r\n[ ] 2 weeks carafate due to recent banding. \r\n[ ] Recommend referral by PCP to outpatient/inpatient treatment \r\nfor alcohol use disorder if patient is amenable. \r\n[ ] Patient discharged with home ___ and ___. \r\n\r\nCODE STATUS: Full\r\nCONTACT: ___, ___\r\n\r\nACUTE ISSUES:\r\n============\r\n#Acute blood loss anemia ___ upper GI bleed, likely ___ large \r\nmarginal ulcer versus variceal bleeding \r\nThe patient presented from HD due to shortness of breath \r\nbelieved to be ___ pulmonary edema from a previously missed HD \r\nsession. Upon presentation to the ED, she was noted to have \r\nmelena and her Hb was 5, and she was transferred to the ICU. She \r\nrequired 3u pRBCs while there. She had an EGD which showed one \r\ngrade 3 varix in the distal esophagus with stigmata of recent \r\nbleeding s/p ligation, and at the RNY gastrojejunostomy \r\nencountered a large marginal ulcer with white mucous plug at \r\nanastomosis and no evidence of active bleeding. Following her \r\nEGD, she was transferred to ET and placed on high dose PPI, \r\ncarafate BID (reduced given renal dysfunction), ceftriaxone 1g \r\nIV for SBP prophylaxis. Octreotide drip was discontinued. Due to \r\nher low blood pressures she is unable to tolerate nadolol. She \r\nwas discharged with Hgb 7.3.\r\n\r\n#Alcoholic cirrhosis c/b hepatic encephalopathy\r\nThe patient described an extensive history of alcohol use, \r\nincluding up to the day prior to her admission. On presentation \r\nshe had asterixis on her exam and was noted to be somnolent. She \r\nwas given lactulose TID and part of her encephalopathy was \r\npresumed related to uremia from missing HD; this was treated on \r\nher ___ HD session. Her bleeding was treated as above, and \r\nshe was noted to have abdominal discomfort on exam, confirmed by \r\nmoderate ascites on CT exam. She will require continued \r\nmonitoring of GI bleed risk, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy \r\nas an outpatient, especially in the setting of continued alcohol \r\nuse.\r\n\r\n#Alcohol use disorder. Discharged from rehab for alcohol \r\ndisorder a few weeks ago, but described her last drink as \r\nmidnight the night prior to presentation to the ED. She was \r\nreported to be somnolent in the ED. She had no signs or symptoms \r\nof withdrawal but was placed on CIWA protocol and did not score. \r\nShe was given high dose thiamine for 3 days, folate, and social \r\nwork was consulted. On multiple occasions the team discussed \r\nwith her the importance of stopping alcohol. We spoke to her \r\nmother on the day of discharge and instructed her to discard all \r\nalcohol from the home prior to discharge. \r\n\r\n#Peripheral edema. She had lower extremity swelling (R>L) and as \r\na result had a lower extremity doppler ultrasound that showed no \r\nevidence of clot. The patient described this as a chronic issue \r\nfor her, no further work-up was completed.\r\n\r\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\r\n==============\r\n#ESRD on HD\r\n#Anion gap metabolic acidosis. Received HD while inpatient. \r\nAcidosis presumed ___ renal disease.\r\n\r\n#Chronic pancreatitis.

She had variceal banding and was noted to have a \r\nlarge ulcer on EGD while in the ICU, these were considered to be \r\nthe source of her bleeding, and she was medically optimized to \r\nprevent re-bleeding following the EGD on the ET service. She \r\nremained stable once out of the ICU, received HD, and was \r\ndischarged home in stable condition.\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n==================\r\n[ ] Complex cyst in the midpole of the right kidney, likely a \r\nhemorrahgic cyst. Recommend follow up in 6 months to assess for \r\ninterval change. \r\n[ ] Unable to start BB inpatient due to low BPs (and patient is \r\non high dose midodrine). If able to tolerate, please start BB \r\ngiven her varices. \r\n[ ] Requires a follow-up EGD in ___. \r\n[ ] 6 weeks of BID PPI, then recommend taper down to once daily. \r\n\r\n[ ] 2 weeks carafate due to recent banding. \r\n[ ] Recommend referral by PCP to outpatient/inpatient treatment \r\nfor alcohol use disorder if patient is amenable. \r\n[ ] Patient discharged with home ___ and ___. \r\n\r\nCODE STATUS: Full\r\nCONTACT: ___, ___\r\n\r\nACUTE ISSUES:\r\n============\r\n#Acute blood loss anemia ___ upper GI bleed, likely ___ large \r\nmarginal ulcer versus variceal bleeding \r\nThe patient presented from HD due to shortness of breath \r\nbelieved to be ___ pulmonary edema from a previously missed HD \r\nsession. Upon presentation to the ED, she was noted to have \r\nmelena and her Hb was 5, and she was transferred to the ICU. She \r\nrequired 3u pRBCs while there. She had an EGD which showed one \r\ngrade 3 varix in the distal esophagus with stigmata of recent \r\nbleeding s/p ligation, and at the RNY gastrojejunostomy \r\nencountered a large marginal ulcer with white mucous plug at \r\nanastomosis and no evidence of active bleeding. Following her \r\nEGD, she was transferred to ET and placed on high dose PPI, \r\ncarafate BID (reduced given renal dysfunction), ceftriaxone 1g \r\nIV for SBP prophylaxis. Octreotide drip was discontinued. Due to \r\nher low blood pressures she is unable to tolerate nadolol. She \r\nwas discharged with Hgb 7.3.\r\n\r\n#Alcoholic cirrhosis c/b hepatic encephalopathy\r\nThe patient described an extensive history of alcohol use, \r\nincluding up to the day prior to her admission. On presentation \r\nshe had asterixis on her exam and was noted to be somnolent. She \r\nwas given lactulose TID and part of her encephalopathy was \r\npresumed related to uremia from missing HD; this was treated on \r\nher ___ HD session. Her bleeding was treated as above, and \r\nshe was noted to have abdominal discomfort on exam, confirmed by \r\nmoderate ascites on CT exam. She will require continued \r\nmonitoring of GI bleed risk, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy \r\nas an outpatient, especially in the setting of continued alcohol \r\nuse.\r\n\r\n#Alcohol use disorder. Discharged from rehab for alcohol \r\ndisorder a few weeks ago, but described her last drink as \r\nmidnight the night prior to presentation to the ED. She was \r\nreported to be somnolent in the ED. She had no signs or symptoms \r\nof withdrawal but was placed on CIWA protocol and did not score. \r\nShe was given high dose thiamine for 3 days, folate, and social \r\nwork was consulted. On multiple occasions the team discussed \r\nwith her the importance of stopping alcohol. We spoke to her \r\nmother on the day of discharge and instructed her to discard all \r\nalcohol from the home prior to discharge. \r\n\r\n#Peripheral edema. She had lower extremity swelling (R>L) and as \r\na result had a lower extremity doppler ultrasound that showed no \r\nevidence of clot. The patient described this as a chronic issue \r\nfor her, no further work-up was completed.\r\n\r\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\r\n==============\r\n#ESRD on HD\r\n#Anion gap metabolic acidosis. Received HD while inpatient. \r\nAcidosis presumed ___ renal disease.\r\n\r\n#Chronic pancreatitis.

She had variceal banding and was noted to have a \r\nlarge ulcer on EGD while in the ICU, these were considered to be \r\nthe source of her bleeding, and she was medically optimized to \r\nprevent re-bleeding following the EGD on the ET service. She \r\nremained stable once out of the ICU, received HD, and was \r\ndischarged home in stable condition.\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n==================\r\n[ ] Complex cyst in the midpole of the right kidney, likely a \r\nhemorrahgic cyst. Recommend follow up in 6 months to assess for \r\ninterval change. \r\n[ ] Unable to start BB inpatient due to low BPs (and patient is \r\non high dose midodrine). If able to tolerate, please start BB \r\ngiven her varices. \r\n[ ] Requires a follow-up EGD in ___. \r\n[ ] 6 weeks of BID PPI, then recommend taper down to once daily. \r\n\r\n[ ] 2 weeks carafate due to recent banding. \r\n[ ] Recommend referral by PCP to outpatient/inpatient treatment \r\nfor alcohol use disorder if patient is amenable. \r\n[ ] Patient discharged with home ___ and ___. \r\n\r\nCODE STATUS: Full\r\nCONTACT: ___, ___\r\n\r\nACUTE ISSUES:\r\n============\r\n#Acute blood loss anemia ___ upper GI bleed, likely ___ large \r\nmarginal ulcer versus variceal bleeding \r\nThe patient presented from HD due to shortness of breath \r\nbelieved to be ___ pulmonary edema from a previously missed HD \r\nsession. Upon presentation to the ED, she was noted to have \r\nmelena and her Hb was 5, and she was transferred to the ICU. She \r\nrequired 3u pRBCs while there. She had an EGD which showed one \r\ngrade 3 varix in the distal esophagus with stigmata of recent \r\nbleeding s/p ligation, and at the RNY gastrojejunostomy \r\nencountered a large marginal ulcer with white mucous plug at \r\nanastomosis and no evidence of active bleeding. Following her \r\nEGD, she was transferred to ET and placed on high dose PPI, \r\ncarafate BID (reduced given renal dysfunction), ceftriaxone 1g \r\nIV for SBP prophylaxis. Octreotide drip was discontinued. Due to \r\nher low blood pressures she is unable to tolerate nadolol. She \r\nwas discharged with Hgb 7.3.\r\n\r\n#Alcoholic cirrhosis c/b hepatic encephalopathy\r\nThe patient described an extensive history of alcohol use, \r\nincluding up to the day prior to her admission. On presentation \r\nshe had asterixis on her exam and was noted to be somnolent. She \r\nwas given lactulose TID and part of her encephalopathy was \r\npresumed related to uremia from missing HD; this was treated on \r\nher ___ HD session. Her bleeding was treated as above, and \r\nshe was noted to have abdominal discomfort on exam, confirmed by \r\nmoderate ascites on CT exam. She will require continued \r\nmonitoring of GI bleed risk, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy \r\nas an outpatient, especially in the setting of continued alcohol \r\nuse.\r\n\r\n#Alcohol use disorder. Discharged from rehab for alcohol \r\ndisorder a few weeks ago, but described her last drink as \r\nmidnight the night prior to presentation to the ED. She was \r\nreported to be somnolent in the ED. She had no signs or symptoms \r\nof withdrawal but was placed on CIWA protocol and did not score. \r\nShe was given high dose thiamine for 3 days, folate, and social \r\nwork was consulted. On multiple occasions the team discussed \r\nwith her the importance of stopping alcohol. We spoke to her \r\nmother on the day of discharge and instructed her to discard all \r\nalcohol from the home prior to discharge. \r\n\r\n#Peripheral edema. She had lower extremity swelling (R>L) and as \r\na result had a lower extremity doppler ultrasound that showed no \r\nevidence of clot. The patient described this as a chronic issue \r\nfor her, no further work-up was completed.\r\n\r\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\r\n==============\r\n#ESRD on HD\r\n#Anion gap metabolic acidosis.

She had variceal banding and was noted to have a \r\nlarge ulcer on EGD while in the ICU, these were considered to be \r\nthe source of her bleeding, and she was medically optimized to \r\nprevent re-bleeding following the EGD on the ET service. She \r\nremained stable once out of the ICU, received HD, and was \r\ndischarged home in stable condition.\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n==================\r\n[ ] Complex cyst in the midpole of the right kidney, likely a \r\nhemorrahgic cyst. Recommend follow up in 6 months to assess for \r\ninterval change. \r\n[ ] Unable to start BB inpatient due to low BPs (and patient is \r\non high dose midodrine). If able to tolerate, please start BB \r\ngiven her varices. \r\n[ ] Requires a follow-up EGD in ___. \r\n[ ] 6 weeks of BID PPI, then recommend taper down to once daily. \r\n\r\n[ ] 2 weeks carafate due to recent banding. \r\n[ ] Recommend referral by PCP to outpatient/inpatient treatment \r\nfor alcohol use disorder if patient is amenable. \r\n[ ] Patient discharged with home ___ and ___. \r\n\r\nCODE STATUS: Full\r\nCONTACT: ___, ___\r\n\r\nACUTE ISSUES:\r\n============\r\n#Acute blood loss anemia ___ upper GI bleed, likely ___ large \r\nmarginal ulcer versus variceal bleeding \r\nThe patient presented from HD due to shortness of breath \r\nbelieved to be ___ pulmonary edema from a previously missed HD \r\nsession. Upon presentation to the ED, she was noted to have \r\nmelena and her Hb was 5, and she was transferred to the ICU. She \r\nrequired 3u pRBCs while there. She had an EGD which showed one \r\ngrade 3 varix in the distal esophagus with stigmata of recent \r\nbleeding s/p ligation, and at the RNY gastrojejunostomy \r\nencountered a large marginal ulcer with white mucous plug at \r\nanastomosis and no evidence of active bleeding. Following her \r\nEGD, she was transferred to ET and placed on high dose PPI, \r\ncarafate BID (reduced given renal dysfunction), ceftriaxone 1g \r\nIV for SBP prophylaxis. Octreotide drip was discontinued. Due to \r\nher low blood pressures she is unable to tolerate nadolol. She \r\nwas discharged with Hgb 7.3.\r\n\r\n#Alcoholic cirrhosis c/b hepatic encephalopathy\r\nThe patient described an extensive history of alcohol use, \r\nincluding up to the day prior to her admission. On presentation \r\nshe had asterixis on her exam and was noted to be somnolent. She \r\nwas given lactulose TID and part of her encephalopathy was \r\npresumed related to uremia from missing HD; this was treated on \r\nher ___ HD session. Her bleeding was treated as above, and \r\nshe was noted to have abdominal discomfort on exam, confirmed by \r\nmoderate ascites on CT exam. She will require continued \r\nmonitoring of GI bleed risk, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy \r\nas an outpatient, especially in the setting of continued alcohol \r\nuse.\r\n\r\n#Alcohol use disorder. Discharged from rehab for alcohol \r\ndisorder a few weeks ago, but described her last drink as \r\nmidnight the night prior to presentation to the ED. She was \r\nreported to be somnolent in the ED. She had no signs or symptoms \r\nof withdrawal but was placed on CIWA protocol and did not score. \r\nShe was given high dose thiamine for 3 days, folate, and social \r\nwork was consulted. On multiple occasions the team discussed \r\nwith her the importance of stopping alcohol. We spoke to her \r\nmother on the day of discharge and instructed her to discard all \r\nalcohol from the home prior to discharge. \r\n\r\n#Peripheral edema. She had lower extremity swelling (R>L) and as \r\na result had a lower extremity doppler ultrasound that showed no \r\nevidence of clot. The patient described this as a chronic issue \r\nfor her, no further work-up was completed.\r\n\r\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\r\n==============\r\n#ESRD on HD\r\n#Anion gap metabolic acidosis.

She had variceal banding and was noted to have a \r\nlarge ulcer on EGD while in the ICU, these were considered to be \r\nthe source of her bleeding, and she was medically optimized to \r\nprevent re-bleeding following the EGD on the ET service. She \r\nremained stable once out of the ICU, received HD, and was \r\ndischarged home in stable condition.\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n==================\r\n[ ] Complex cyst in the midpole of the right kidney, likely a \r\nhemorrahgic cyst. Recommend follow up in 6 months to assess for \r\ninterval change. \r\n[ ] Unable to start BB inpatient due to low BPs (and patient is \r\non high dose midodrine). If able to tolerate, please start BB \r\ngiven her varices. \r\n[ ] Requires a follow-up EGD in ___. \r\n[ ] 6 weeks of BID PPI, then recommend taper down to once daily. \r\n\r\n[ ] 2 weeks carafate due to recent banding. \r\n[ ] Recommend referral by PCP to outpatient/inpatient treatment \r\nfor alcohol use disorder if patient is amenable. \r\n[ ] Patient discharged with home ___ and ___. \r\n\r\nCODE STATUS: Full\r\nCONTACT: ___, ___\r\n\r\nACUTE ISSUES:\r\n============\r\n#Acute blood loss anemia ___ upper GI bleed, likely ___ large \r\nmarginal ulcer versus variceal bleeding \r\nThe patient presented from HD due to shortness of breath \r\nbelieved to be ___ pulmonary edema from a previously missed HD \r\nsession. Upon presentation to the ED, she was noted to have \r\nmelena and her Hb was 5, and she was transferred to the ICU. She \r\nrequired 3u pRBCs while there. She had an EGD which showed one \r\ngrade 3 varix in the distal esophagus with stigmata of recent \r\nbleeding s/p ligation, and at the RNY gastrojejunostomy \r\nencountered a large marginal ulcer with white mucous plug at \r\nanastomosis and no evidence of active bleeding. Following her \r\nEGD, she was transferred to ET and placed on high dose PPI, \r\ncarafate BID (reduced given renal dysfunction), ceftriaxone 1g \r\nIV for SBP prophylaxis. Octreotide drip was discontinued. Due to \r\nher low blood pressures she is unable to tolerate nadolol. She \r\nwas discharged with Hgb 7.3.\r\n\r\n#Alcoholic cirrhosis c/b hepatic encephalopathy\r\nThe patient described an extensive history of alcohol use, \r\nincluding up to the day prior to her admission. On presentation \r\nshe had asterixis on her exam and was noted to be somnolent. She \r\nwas given lactulose TID and part of her encephalopathy was \r\npresumed related to uremia from missing HD; this was treated on \r\nher ___ HD session. Her bleeding was treated as above, and \r\nshe was noted to have abdominal discomfort on exam, confirmed by \r\nmoderate ascites on CT exam. She will require continued \r\nmonitoring of GI bleed risk, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy \r\nas an outpatient, especially in the setting of continued alcohol \r\nuse.\r\n\r\n#Alcohol use disorder. Discharged from rehab for alcohol \r\ndisorder a few weeks ago, but described her last drink as \r\nmidnight the night prior to presentation to the ED. She was \r\nreported to be somnolent in the ED. She had no signs or symptoms \r\nof withdrawal but was placed on CIWA protocol and did not score. \r\nShe was given high dose thiamine for 3 days, folate, and social \r\nwork was consulted. On multiple occasions the team discussed \r\nwith her the importance of stopping alcohol. We spoke to her \r\nmother on the day of discharge and instructed her to discard all \r\nalcohol from the home prior to discharge. \r\n\r\n#Peripheral edema. She had lower extremity swelling (R>L) and as \r\na result had a lower extremity doppler ultrasound that showed no \r\nevidence of clot. The patient described this as a chronic issue \r\nfor her, no further work-up was completed.\r\n\r\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\r\n==============\r\n#ESRD on HD\r\n#Anion gap metabolic acidosis. Received HD while inpatient. \r\nAcidosis presumed ___ renal disease.\r\n\r\n#Chronic pancreatitis.

She had variceal banding and was noted to have a \r\nlarge ulcer on EGD while in the ICU, these were considered to be \r\nthe source of her bleeding, and she was medically optimized to \r\nprevent re-bleeding following the EGD on the ET service. She \r\nremained stable once out of the ICU, received HD, and was \r\ndischarged home in stable condition.\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n==================\r\n[ ] Complex cyst in the midpole of the right kidney, likely a \r\nhemorrahgic cyst. Recommend follow up in 6 months to assess for \r\ninterval change. \r\n[ ] Unable to start BB inpatient due to low BPs (and patient is \r\non high dose midodrine). If able to tolerate, please start BB \r\ngiven her varices. \r\n[ ] Requires a follow-up EGD in ___. \r\n[ ] 6 weeks of BID PPI, then recommend taper down to once daily. \r\n\r\n[ ] 2 weeks carafate due to recent banding. \r\n[ ] Recommend referral by PCP to outpatient/inpatient treatment \r\nfor alcohol use disorder if patient is amenable. \r\n[ ] Patient discharged with home ___ and ___. \r\n\r\nCODE STATUS: Full\r\nCONTACT: ___, ___\r\n\r\nACUTE ISSUES:\r\n============\r\n#Acute blood loss anemia ___ upper GI bleed, likely ___ large \r\nmarginal ulcer versus variceal bleeding \r\nThe patient presented from HD due to shortness of breath \r\nbelieved to be ___ pulmonary edema from a previously missed HD \r\nsession. Upon presentation to the ED, she was noted to have \r\nmelena and her Hb was 5, and she was transferred to the ICU. She \r\nrequired 3u pRBCs while there. She had an EGD which showed one \r\ngrade 3 varix in the distal esophagus with stigmata of recent \r\nbleeding s/p ligation, and at the RNY gastrojejunostomy \r\nencountered a large marginal ulcer with white mucous plug at \r\nanastomosis and no evidence of active bleeding. Following her \r\nEGD, she was transferred to ET and placed on high dose PPI, \r\ncarafate BID (reduced given renal dysfunction), ceftriaxone 1g \r\nIV for SBP prophylaxis. Octreotide drip was discontinued. Due to \r\nher low blood pressures she is unable to tolerate nadolol. She \r\nwas discharged with Hgb 7.3.\r\n\r\n#Alcoholic cirrhosis c/b hepatic encephalopathy\r\nThe patient described an extensive history of alcohol use, \r\nincluding up to the day prior to her admission. On presentation \r\nshe had asterixis on her exam and was noted to be somnolent. She \r\nwas given lactulose TID and part of her encephalopathy was \r\npresumed related to uremia from missing HD; this was treated on \r\nher ___ HD session. Her bleeding was treated as above, and \r\nshe was noted to have abdominal discomfort on exam, confirmed by \r\nmoderate ascites on CT exam. She will require continued \r\nmonitoring of GI bleed risk, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy \r\nas an outpatient, especially in the setting of continued alcohol \r\nuse.\r\n\r\n#Alcohol use disorder. Discharged from rehab for alcohol \r\ndisorder a few weeks ago, but described her last drink as \r\nmidnight the night prior to presentation to the ED. She was \r\nreported to be somnolent in the ED. She had no signs or symptoms \r\nof withdrawal but was placed on CIWA protocol and did not score. \r\nShe was given high dose thiamine for 3 days, folate, and social \r\nwork was consulted. On multiple occasions the team discussed \r\nwith her the importance of stopping alcohol. We spoke to her \r\nmother on the day of discharge and instructed her to discard all \r\nalcohol from the home prior to discharge. \r\n\r\n#Peripheral edema. She had lower extremity swelling (R>L) and as \r\na result had a lower extremity doppler ultrasound that showed no \r\nevidence of clot. The patient described this as a chronic issue \r\nfor her, no further work-up was completed.\r\n\r\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\r\n==============\r\n#ESRD on HD\r\n#Anion gap metabolic acidosis. Received HD while inpatient. \r\nAcidosis presumed ___ renal disease.\r\n\r\n#Chronic pancreatitis.

She had variceal banding and was noted to have a \r\nlarge ulcer on EGD while in the ICU, these were considered to be \r\nthe source of her bleeding, and she was medically optimized to \r\nprevent re-bleeding following the EGD on the ET service. She \r\nremained stable once out of the ICU, received HD, and was \r\ndischarged home in stable condition.\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n==================\r\n[ ] Complex cyst in the midpole of the right kidney, likely a \r\nhemorrahgic cyst. Recommend follow up in 6 months to assess for \r\ninterval change. \r\n[ ] Unable to start BB inpatient due to low BPs (and patient is \r\non high dose midodrine). If able to tolerate, please start BB \r\ngiven her varices. \r\n[ ] Requires a follow-up EGD in ___. \r\n[ ] 6 weeks of BID PPI, then recommend taper down to once daily. \r\n\r\n[ ] 2 weeks carafate due to recent banding. \r\n[ ] Recommend referral by PCP to outpatient/inpatient treatment \r\nfor alcohol use disorder if patient is amenable. \r\n[ ] Patient discharged with home ___ and ___. \r\n\r\nCODE STATUS: Full\r\nCONTACT: ___, ___\r\n\r\nACUTE ISSUES:\r\n============\r\n#Acute blood loss anemia ___ upper GI bleed, likely ___ large \r\nmarginal ulcer versus variceal bleeding \r\nThe patient presented from HD due to shortness of breath \r\nbelieved to be ___ pulmonary edema from a previously missed HD \r\nsession. Upon presentation to the ED, she was noted to have \r\nmelena and her Hb was 5, and she was transferred to the ICU. She \r\nrequired 3u pRBCs while there. She had an EGD which showed one \r\ngrade 3 varix in the distal esophagus with stigmata of recent \r\nbleeding s/p ligation, and at the RNY gastrojejunostomy \r\nencountered a large marginal ulcer with white mucous plug at \r\nanastomosis and no evidence of active bleeding. Following her \r\nEGD, she was transferred to ET and placed on high dose PPI, \r\ncarafate BID (reduced given renal dysfunction), ceftriaxone 1g \r\nIV for SBP prophylaxis. Octreotide drip was discontinued. Due to \r\nher low blood pressures she is unable to tolerate nadolol. She \r\nwas discharged with Hgb 7.3.\r\n\r\n#Alcoholic cirrhosis c/b hepatic encephalopathy\r\nThe patient described an extensive history of alcohol use, \r\nincluding up to the day prior to her admission. On presentation \r\nshe had asterixis on her exam and was noted to be somnolent. She \r\nwas given lactulose TID and part of her encephalopathy was \r\npresumed related to uremia from missing HD; this was treated on \r\nher ___ HD session. Her bleeding was treated as above, and \r\nshe was noted to have abdominal discomfort on exam, confirmed by \r\nmoderate ascites on CT exam. She will require continued \r\nmonitoring of GI bleed risk, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy \r\nas an outpatient, especially in the setting of continued alcohol \r\nuse.\r\n\r\n#Alcohol use disorder. Discharged from rehab for alcohol \r\ndisorder a few weeks ago, but described her last drink as \r\nmidnight the night prior to presentation to the ED. She was \r\nreported to be somnolent in the ED. She had no signs or symptoms \r\nof withdrawal but was placed on CIWA protocol and did not score. \r\nShe was given high dose thiamine for 3 days, folate, and social \r\nwork was consulted. On multiple occasions the team discussed \r\nwith her the importance of stopping alcohol. We spoke to her \r\nmother on the day of discharge and instructed her to discard all \r\nalcohol from the home prior to discharge. \r\n\r\n#Peripheral edema. She had lower extremity swelling (R>L) and as \r\na result had a lower extremity doppler ultrasound that showed no \r\nevidence of clot. The patient described this as a chronic issue \r\nfor her, no further work-up was completed.\r\n\r\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\r\n==============\r\n#ESRD on HD\r\n#Anion gap metabolic acidosis. Received HD while inpatient. \r\nAcidosis presumed ___ renal disease.\r\n\r\n#Chronic pancreatitis.

She had variceal banding and was noted to have a \r\nlarge ulcer on EGD while in the ICU, these were considered to be \r\nthe source of her bleeding, and she was medically optimized to \r\nprevent re-bleeding following the EGD on the ET service. She \r\nremained stable once out of the ICU, received HD, and was \r\ndischarged home in stable condition.\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n==================\r\n[ ] Complex cyst in the midpole of the right kidney, likely a \r\nhemorrahgic cyst. Recommend follow up in 6 months to assess for \r\ninterval change. \r\n[ ] Unable to start BB inpatient due to low BPs (and patient is \r\non high dose midodrine). If able to tolerate, please start BB \r\ngiven her varices. \r\n[ ] Requires a follow-up EGD in ___. \r\n[ ] 6 weeks of BID PPI, then recommend taper down to once daily. \r\n\r\n[ ] 2 weeks carafate due to recent banding. \r\n[ ] Recommend referral by PCP to outpatient/inpatient treatment \r\nfor alcohol use disorder if patient is amenable. \r\n[ ] Patient discharged with home ___ and ___. \r\n\r\nCODE STATUS: Full\r\nCONTACT: ___, ___\r\n\r\nACUTE ISSUES:\r\n============\r\n#Acute blood loss anemia ___ upper GI bleed, likely ___ large \r\nmarginal ulcer versus variceal bleeding \r\nThe patient presented from HD due to shortness of breath \r\nbelieved to be ___ pulmonary edema from a previously missed HD \r\nsession. Upon presentation to the ED, she was noted to have \r\nmelena and her Hb was 5, and she was transferred to the ICU. She \r\nrequired 3u pRBCs while there. She had an EGD which showed one \r\ngrade 3 varix in the distal esophagus with stigmata of recent \r\nbleeding s/p ligation, and at the RNY gastrojejunostomy \r\nencountered a large marginal ulcer with white mucous plug at \r\nanastomosis and no evidence of active bleeding. Following her \r\nEGD, she was transferred to ET and placed on high dose PPI, \r\ncarafate BID (reduced given renal dysfunction), ceftriaxone 1g \r\nIV for SBP prophylaxis. Octreotide drip was discontinued. Due to \r\nher low blood pressures she is unable to tolerate nadolol. She \r\nwas discharged with Hgb 7.3.\r\n\r\n#Alcoholic cirrhosis c/b hepatic encephalopathy\r\nThe patient described an extensive history of alcohol use, \r\nincluding up to the day prior to her admission. On presentation \r\nshe had asterixis on her exam and was noted to be somnolent. She \r\nwas given lactulose TID and part of her encephalopathy was \r\npresumed related to uremia from missing HD; this was treated on \r\nher ___ HD session. Her bleeding was treated as above, and \r\nshe was noted to have abdominal discomfort on exam, confirmed by \r\nmoderate ascites on CT exam. She will require continued \r\nmonitoring of GI bleed risk, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy \r\nas an outpatient, especially in the setting of continued alcohol \r\nuse.\r\n\r\n#Alcohol use disorder. Discharged from rehab for alcohol \r\ndisorder a few weeks ago, but described her last drink as \r\nmidnight the night prior to presentation to the ED. She was \r\nreported to be somnolent in the ED. She had no signs or symptoms \r\nof withdrawal but was placed on CIWA protocol and did not score. \r\nShe was given high dose thiamine for 3 days, folate, and social \r\nwork was consulted. On multiple occasions the team discussed \r\nwith her the importance of stopping alcohol. We spoke to her \r\nmother on the day of discharge and instructed her to discard all \r\nalcohol from the home prior to discharge. \r\n\r\n#Peripheral edema. She had lower extremity swelling (R>L) and as \r\na result had a lower extremity doppler ultrasound that showed no \r\nevidence of clot. The patient described this as a chronic issue \r\nfor her, no further work-up was completed.\r\n\r\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\r\n==============\r\n#ESRD on HD\r\n#Anion gap metabolic acidosis. Received HD while inpatient. \r\nAcidosis presumed ___ renal disease.\r\n\r\n#Chronic pancreatitis.

She had variceal banding and was noted to have a \r\nlarge ulcer on EGD while in the ICU, these were considered to be \r\nthe source of her bleeding, and she was medically optimized to \r\nprevent re-bleeding following the EGD on the ET service. She \r\nremained stable once out of the ICU, received HD, and was \r\ndischarged home in stable condition.\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n==================\r\n[ ] Complex cyst in the midpole of the right kidney, likely a \r\nhemorrahgic cyst. Recommend follow up in 6 months to assess for \r\ninterval change. \r\n[ ] Unable to start BB inpatient due to low BPs (and patient is \r\non high dose midodrine). If able to tolerate, please start BB \r\ngiven her varices. \r\n[ ] Requires a follow-up EGD in ___. \r\n[ ] 6 weeks of BID PPI, then recommend taper down to once daily. \r\n\r\n[ ] 2 weeks carafate due to recent banding. \r\n[ ] Recommend referral by PCP to outpatient/inpatient treatment \r\nfor alcohol use disorder if patient is amenable. \r\n[ ] Patient discharged with home ___ and ___. \r\n\r\nCODE STATUS: Full\r\nCONTACT: ___, ___\r\n\r\nACUTE ISSUES:\r\n============\r\n#Acute blood loss anemia ___ upper GI bleed, likely ___ large \r\nmarginal ulcer versus variceal bleeding \r\nThe patient presented from HD due to shortness of breath \r\nbelieved to be ___ pulmonary edema from a previously missed HD \r\nsession. Upon presentation to the ED, she was noted to have \r\nmelena and her Hb was 5, and she was transferred to the ICU. She \r\nrequired 3u pRBCs while there. She had an EGD which showed one \r\ngrade 3 varix in the distal esophagus with stigmata of recent \r\nbleeding s/p ligation, and at the RNY gastrojejunostomy \r\nencountered a large marginal ulcer with white mucous plug at \r\nanastomosis and no evidence of active bleeding. Following her \r\nEGD, she was transferred to ET and placed on high dose PPI, \r\ncarafate BID (reduced given renal dysfunction), ceftriaxone 1g \r\nIV for SBP prophylaxis. Octreotide drip was discontinued. Due to \r\nher low blood pressures she is unable to tolerate nadolol. She \r\nwas discharged with Hgb 7.3.\r\n\r\n#Alcoholic cirrhosis c/b hepatic encephalopathy\r\nThe patient described an extensive history of alcohol use, \r\nincluding up to the day prior to her admission. On presentation \r\nshe had asterixis on her exam and was noted to be somnolent. She \r\nwas given lactulose TID and part of her encephalopathy was \r\npresumed related to uremia from missing HD; this was treated on \r\nher ___ HD session. Her bleeding was treated as above, and \r\nshe was noted to have abdominal discomfort on exam, confirmed by \r\nmoderate ascites on CT exam. She will require continued \r\nmonitoring of GI bleed risk, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy \r\nas an outpatient, especially in the setting of continued alcohol \r\nuse.\r\n\r\n#Alcohol use disorder. Discharged from rehab for alcohol \r\ndisorder a few weeks ago, but described her last drink as \r\nmidnight the night prior to presentation to the ED. She was \r\nreported to be somnolent in the ED. She had no signs or symptoms \r\nof withdrawal but was placed on CIWA protocol and did not score. \r\nShe was given high dose thiamine for 3 days, folate, and social \r\nwork was consulted. On multiple occasions the team discussed \r\nwith her the importance of stopping alcohol. We spoke to her \r\nmother on the day of discharge and instructed her to discard all \r\nalcohol from the home prior to discharge. \r\n\r\n#Peripheral edema. She had lower extremity swelling (R>L) and as \r\na result had a lower extremity doppler ultrasound that showed no \r\nevidence of clot. The patient described this as a chronic issue \r\nfor her, no further work-up was completed.\r\n\r\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\r\n==============\r\n#ESRD on HD\r\n#Anion gap metabolic acidosis.

The patient required 2u pRBCs for low Hgb \r\nin the ED and was noted to be lethargic, her lactulose was \r\nincreased and she received HD and her mentation improved. She \r\nwas discharged AAOx3 in stable condition.\r\n\r\nACUTE ISSUES:\r\n=============\r\n#Hepatic encephalopathy\r\n#Uremic encephalopathy\r\n#AMS\r\nThe patient presented from her hemodialysis center to the ED w/ \r\nlethargy and a known recent fall down a flight of stairs. At the \r\ntime of presentation, she was noted to be lethargic but able to \r\nconverse without difficulty. Upon arrival to the floor, she \r\nremained lethargic but arousable to voice and able to follow \r\ncommands. She described not taking her lactulose recently, \r\nmissing a session of HD as a result of her lethargy, and recent \r\nalcohol use. HE, uremic encephalopathy, and alcohol use were all \r\nconsidered as etiologies for her AMS. She was given lactulose at \r\nan increased rate and had runs of HD on back-to-back days. Her \r\nmentation improved to baseline, AAOx3, and she was returned to \r\nher usual lactulose dose and TTS HD schedule at time of \r\ndischarge.\r\n\r\n#Alcoholic hallucinosis\r\nOn day two of her hospitalization the patient described a \r\nhallucination in which a man was standing over her and repeating \r\nher name, ___ She was frightened and unwilling to open her \r\neyes. This was concerning for alcoholic hallucinosis given the \r\ntime frame and her recent alcohol use, so she was placed on CIWA \r\nprotocol w/ lorazepam for management. By day three, her \r\nhallucinations had ceased and at time of discharge she was out \r\nof the alcohol withdrawal window.\r\n\r\n#Acute on chronic blood loss anemia\r\nAt admission to the ED, the patient was noted to have a Hgb <7, \r\nso she was given 2u pRBCs, to which she bumped appropriately. \r\nShe has a history of esophageal varices so she was monitored \r\nwith daily CBCs and her Hgb remained > 7 for the rest of her \r\nstay. She had no evidence of blood loss (no melena, hematemesis, \r\nBRBPR) throughout her hospitalization. Given her recent fall, a \r\nCT was ordered to assess for an RP bleed but was negative.\r\n\r\n#Fall ___ alcohol use\r\nThe patient states that she had been drinking and was exiting \r\nher closet at which point she fell down a flight of stairs. On \r\nadmission, she had ecchymoses on her arms, legs, and scalp. CT \r\nhead negative for intracranial hemorrhage, CT c-spine negative, \r\nand shoulder XR normal. She saw ___ while inpatient who \r\nrecommended further ___ while outpatient, for which patient \r\nalready has ___ services.\r\n\r\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\r\n===============\r\n#Alcoholic cirrhosis\r\nPatient was monitored for signs of GI bleeds, but no evidence. \r\nShe was started on rifaximin. Otherwise monitored daily MELD \r\nlabs.\r\n\r\n#ESRD on HD\r\nDue to concern for uremic encephalopathy, was given HD on two \r\nconsecutive days, then transitioned to home TTS schedule prior \r\nto discharge.\r\n\r\n#Alcohol use disorder\r\nPatient met with social work but stated she does not wish to \r\nstop drinking at this time.

The patient required 2u pRBCs for low Hgb \r\nin the ED and was noted to be lethargic, her lactulose was \r\nincreased and she received HD and her mentation improved. She \r\nwas discharged AAOx3 in stable condition.\r\n\r\nACUTE ISSUES:\r\n=============\r\n#Hepatic encephalopathy\r\n#Uremic encephalopathy\r\n#AMS\r\nThe patient presented from her hemodialysis center to the ED w/ \r\nlethargy and a known recent fall down a flight of stairs. At the \r\ntime of presentation, she was noted to be lethargic but able to \r\nconverse without difficulty. Upon arrival to the floor, she \r\nremained lethargic but arousable to voice and able to follow \r\ncommands. She described not taking her lactulose recently, \r\nmissing a session of HD as a result of her lethargy, and recent \r\nalcohol use. HE, uremic encephalopathy, and alcohol use were all \r\nconsidered as etiologies for her AMS. She was given lactulose at \r\nan increased rate and had runs of HD on back-to-back days. Her \r\nmentation improved to baseline, AAOx3, and she was returned to \r\nher usual lactulose dose and TTS HD schedule at time of \r\ndischarge.\r\n\r\n#Alcoholic hallucinosis\r\nOn day two of her hospitalization the patient described a \r\nhallucination in which a man was standing over her and repeating \r\nher name, ___ She was frightened and unwilling to open her \r\neyes. This was concerning for alcoholic hallucinosis given the \r\ntime frame and her recent alcohol use, so she was placed on CIWA \r\nprotocol w/ lorazepam for management. By day three, her \r\nhallucinations had ceased and at time of discharge she was out \r\nof the alcohol withdrawal window.\r\n\r\n#Acute on chronic blood loss anemia\r\nAt admission to the ED, the patient was noted to have a Hgb <7, \r\nso she was given 2u pRBCs, to which she bumped appropriately. \r\nShe has a history of esophageal varices so she was monitored \r\nwith daily CBCs and her Hgb remained > 7 for the rest of her \r\nstay. She had no evidence of blood loss (no melena, hematemesis, \r\nBRBPR) throughout her hospitalization. Given her recent fall, a \r\nCT was ordered to assess for an RP bleed but was negative.\r\n\r\n#Fall ___ alcohol use\r\nThe patient states that she had been drinking and was exiting \r\nher closet at which point she fell down a flight of stairs. On \r\nadmission, she had ecchymoses on her arms, legs, and scalp. CT \r\nhead negative for intracranial hemorrhage, CT c-spine negative, \r\nand shoulder XR normal. She saw ___ while inpatient who \r\nrecommended further ___ while outpatient, for which patient \r\nalready has ___ services.\r\n\r\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\r\n===============\r\n#Alcoholic cirrhosis\r\nPatient was monitored for signs of GI bleeds, but no evidence. \r\nShe was started on rifaximin. Otherwise monitored daily MELD \r\nlabs.\r\n\r\n#ESRD on HD\r\nDue to concern for uremic encephalopathy, was given HD on two \r\nconsecutive days, then transitioned to home TTS schedule prior \r\nto discharge.\r\n\r\n#Alcohol use disorder\r\nPatient met with social work but stated she does not wish to \r\nstop drinking at this time. Was given resources for relapse \r\nprevention.\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n====================\r\n[ ] Discharge Cr 5.3\r\n[ ] Discharge AST/ALT ___\r\n[ ] Discharge T bili \r\n[ ] Discharge Hgb 7.3\r\n[ ] Patient continues to drink alcohol and would benefit from \r\ntherapy, was given resources from Psychology Today for \r\nclinicians in ___ area that take her insurance and have \r\nexperience in addiction counseling\r\n[ ] Would benefit from further ___ given recent fall\r\n[ ] Weekly CBC and may benefit as an outpatient from scheduled \r\ntransfusions, likely has chronic low volume blood loss from GI \r\nsource leading to anemia\r\n[ ] Would benefit from follow-up on whether she is taking \r\nlactulose, has history of non-compliance leading to \r\nhospitalization\r\n[ ] Has missed HD sessions in the past leading to \r\nhospitalization, could benefit from further counseling\r\n[ ] Had visual hallucinations during alcohol withdrawal and is \r\nactively drinking, on repeat hospitalizations will be important \r\nto monitor for signs of withdrawal, she describes this as her \r\nfirst episode\r\n[ ] New prescription of rifaximin for patient, but at time of \r\ndischarge unclear if insurance will cover/if she needs prior \r\nauth, would recommend following up to see if patient is able to \r\nget medication\r\n[ ] Is taking baclofen for muscle spasms/aches, may be \r\ncontributing to her frequent hospitalizations for AMS, would \r\nconsider re-assessing if necessary in patient\r\n\r\nCODE: FCp\r\nCONTACT: ___ (son) ___ \r\n \r\nMedications on Admission:\r\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\r\n1.

The patient required 2u pRBCs for low Hgb \r\nin the ED and was noted to be lethargic, her lactulose was \r\nincreased and she received HD and her mentation improved. She \r\nwas discharged AAOx3 in stable condition.\r\n\r\nACUTE ISSUES:\r\n=============\r\n#Hepatic encephalopathy\r\n#Uremic encephalopathy\r\n#AMS\r\nThe patient presented from her hemodialysis center to the ED w/ \r\nlethargy and a known recent fall down a flight of stairs. At the \r\ntime of presentation, she was noted to be lethargic but able to \r\nconverse without difficulty. Upon arrival to the floor, she \r\nremained lethargic but arousable to voice and able to follow \r\ncommands. She described not taking her lactulose recently, \r\nmissing a session of HD as a result of her lethargy, and recent \r\nalcohol use. HE, uremic encephalopathy, and alcohol use were all \r\nconsidered as etiologies for her AMS. She was given lactulose at \r\nan increased rate and had runs of HD on back-to-back days. Her \r\nmentation improved to baseline, AAOx3, and she was returned to \r\nher usual lactulose dose and TTS HD schedule at time of \r\ndischarge.\r\n\r\n#Alcoholic hallucinosis\r\nOn day two of her hospitalization the patient described a \r\nhallucination in which a man was standing over her and repeating \r\nher name, ___ She was frightened and unwilling to open her \r\neyes. This was concerning for alcoholic hallucinosis given the \r\ntime frame and her recent alcohol use, so she was placed on CIWA \r\nprotocol w/ lorazepam for management. By day three, her \r\nhallucinations had ceased and at time of discharge she was out \r\nof the alcohol withdrawal window.\r\n\r\n#Acute on chronic blood loss anemia\r\nAt admission to the ED, the patient was noted to have a Hgb <7, \r\nso she was given 2u pRBCs, to which she bumped appropriately. \r\nShe has a history of esophageal varices so she was monitored \r\nwith daily CBCs and her Hgb remained > 7 for the rest of her \r\nstay. She had no evidence of blood loss (no melena, hematemesis, \r\nBRBPR) throughout her hospitalization. Given her recent fall, a \r\nCT was ordered to assess for an RP bleed but was negative.\r\n\r\n#Fall ___ alcohol use\r\nThe patient states that she had been drinking and was exiting \r\nher closet at which point she fell down a flight of stairs. On \r\nadmission, she had ecchymoses on her arms, legs, and scalp. CT \r\nhead negative for intracranial hemorrhage, CT c-spine negative, \r\nand shoulder XR normal. She saw ___ while inpatient who \r\nrecommended further ___ while outpatient, for which patient \r\nalready has ___ services.\r\n\r\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\r\n===============\r\n#Alcoholic cirrhosis\r\nPatient was monitored for signs of GI bleeds, but no evidence. \r\nShe was started on rifaximin. Otherwise monitored daily MELD \r\nlabs.\r\n\r\n#ESRD on HD\r\nDue to concern for uremic encephalopathy, was given HD on two \r\nconsecutive days, then transitioned to home TTS schedule prior \r\nto discharge.\r\n\r\n#Alcohol use disorder\r\nPatient met with social work but stated she does not wish to \r\nstop drinking at this time.

The patient required 2u pRBCs for low Hgb \r\nin the ED and was noted to be lethargic, her lactulose was \r\nincreased and she received HD and her mentation improved. She \r\nwas discharged AAOx3 in stable condition.\r\n\r\nACUTE ISSUES:\r\n=============\r\n#Hepatic encephalopathy\r\n#Uremic encephalopathy\r\n#AMS\r\nThe patient presented from her hemodialysis center to the ED w/ \r\nlethargy and a known recent fall down a flight of stairs. At the \r\ntime of presentation, she was noted to be lethargic but able to \r\nconverse without difficulty. Upon arrival to the floor, she \r\nremained lethargic but arousable to voice and able to follow \r\ncommands. She described not taking her lactulose recently, \r\nmissing a session of HD as a result of her lethargy, and recent \r\nalcohol use. HE, uremic encephalopathy, and alcohol use were all \r\nconsidered as etiologies for her AMS. She was given lactulose at \r\nan increased rate and had runs of HD on back-to-back days. Her \r\nmentation improved to baseline, AAOx3, and she was returned to \r\nher usual lactulose dose and TTS HD schedule at time of \r\ndischarge.\r\n\r\n#Alcoholic hallucinosis\r\nOn day two of her hospitalization the patient described a \r\nhallucination in which a man was standing over her and repeating \r\nher name, ___ She was frightened and unwilling to open her \r\neyes. This was concerning for alcoholic hallucinosis given the \r\ntime frame and her recent alcohol use, so she was placed on CIWA \r\nprotocol w/ lorazepam for management. By day three, her \r\nhallucinations had ceased and at time of discharge she was out \r\nof the alcohol withdrawal window.\r\n\r\n#Acute on chronic blood loss anemia\r\nAt admission to the ED, the patient was noted to have a Hgb <7, \r\nso she was given 2u pRBCs, to which she bumped appropriately. \r\nShe has a history of esophageal varices so she was monitored \r\nwith daily CBCs and her Hgb remained > 7 for the rest of her \r\nstay. She had no evidence of blood loss (no melena, hematemesis, \r\nBRBPR) throughout her hospitalization. Given her recent fall, a \r\nCT was ordered to assess for an RP bleed but was negative.\r\n\r\n#Fall ___ alcohol use\r\nThe patient states that she had been drinking and was exiting \r\nher closet at which point she fell down a flight of stairs. On \r\nadmission, she had ecchymoses on her arms, legs, and scalp. CT \r\nhead negative for intracranial hemorrhage, CT c-spine negative, \r\nand shoulder XR normal. She saw ___ while inpatient who \r\nrecommended further ___ while outpatient, for which patient \r\nalready has ___ services.\r\n\r\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\r\n===============\r\n#Alcoholic cirrhosis\r\nPatient was monitored for signs of GI bleeds, but no evidence. \r\nShe was started on rifaximin. Otherwise monitored daily MELD \r\nlabs.\r\n\r\n#ESRD on HD\r\nDue to concern for uremic encephalopathy, was given HD on two \r\nconsecutive days, then transitioned to home TTS schedule prior \r\nto discharge.\r\n\r\n#Alcohol use disorder\r\nPatient met with social work but stated she does not wish to \r\nstop drinking at this time.

The patient required 2u pRBCs for low Hgb \r\nin the ED and was noted to be lethargic, her lactulose was \r\nincreased and she received HD and her mentation improved. She \r\nwas discharged AAOx3 in stable condition.\r\n\r\nACUTE ISSUES:\r\n=============\r\n#Hepatic encephalopathy\r\n#Uremic encephalopathy\r\n#AMS\r\nThe patient presented from her hemodialysis center to the ED w/ \r\nlethargy and a known recent fall down a flight of stairs. At the \r\ntime of presentation, she was noted to be lethargic but able to \r\nconverse without difficulty. Upon arrival to the floor, she \r\nremained lethargic but arousable to voice and able to follow \r\ncommands. She described not taking her lactulose recently, \r\nmissing a session of HD as a result of her lethargy, and recent \r\nalcohol use. HE, uremic encephalopathy, and alcohol use were all \r\nconsidered as etiologies for her AMS. She was given lactulose at \r\nan increased rate and had runs of HD on back-to-back days. Her \r\nmentation improved to baseline, AAOx3, and she was returned to \r\nher usual lactulose dose and TTS HD schedule at time of \r\ndischarge.\r\n\r\n#Alcoholic hallucinosis\r\nOn day two of her hospitalization the patient described a \r\nhallucination in which a man was standing over her and repeating \r\nher name, ___ She was frightened and unwilling to open her \r\neyes. This was concerning for alcoholic hallucinosis given the \r\ntime frame and her recent alcohol use, so she was placed on CIWA \r\nprotocol w/ lorazepam for management. By day three, her \r\nhallucinations had ceased and at time of discharge she was out \r\nof the alcohol withdrawal window.\r\n\r\n#Acute on chronic blood loss anemia\r\nAt admission to the ED, the patient was noted to have a Hgb <7, \r\nso she was given 2u pRBCs, to which she bumped appropriately. \r\nShe has a history of esophageal varices so she was monitored \r\nwith daily CBCs and her Hgb remained > 7 for the rest of her \r\nstay. She had no evidence of blood loss (no melena, hematemesis, \r\nBRBPR) throughout her hospitalization. Given her recent fall, a \r\nCT was ordered to assess for an RP bleed but was negative.\r\n\r\n#Fall ___ alcohol use\r\nThe patient states that she had been drinking and was exiting \r\nher closet at which point she fell down a flight of stairs. On \r\nadmission, she had ecchymoses on her arms, legs, and scalp. CT \r\nhead negative for intracranial hemorrhage, CT c-spine negative, \r\nand shoulder XR normal. She saw ___ while inpatient who \r\nrecommended further ___ while outpatient, for which patient \r\nalready has ___ services.\r\n\r\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\r\n===============\r\n#Alcoholic cirrhosis\r\nPatient was monitored for signs of GI bleeds, but no evidence. \r\nShe was started on rifaximin. Otherwise monitored daily MELD \r\nlabs.\r\n\r\n#ESRD on HD\r\nDue to concern for uremic encephalopathy, was given HD on two \r\nconsecutive days, then transitioned to home TTS schedule prior \r\nto discharge.\r\n\r\n#Alcohol use disorder\r\nPatient met with social work but stated she does not wish to \r\nstop drinking at this time. Was given resources for relapse \r\nprevention.\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n====================\r\n[ ] Discharge Cr 5.3\r\n[ ] Discharge AST/ALT ___\r\n[ ] Discharge T bili \r\n[ ] Discharge Hgb 7.3\r\n[ ] Patient continues to drink alcohol and would benefit from \r\ntherapy, was given resources from Psychology Today for \r\nclinicians in ___ area that take her insurance and have \r\nexperience in addiction counseling\r\n[ ] Would benefit from further ___ given recent fall\r\n[ ] Weekly CBC and may benefit as an outpatient from scheduled \r\ntransfusions, likely has chronic low volume blood loss from GI \r\nsource leading to anemia\r\n[ ] Would benefit from follow-up on whether she is taking \r\nlactulose, has history of non-compliance leading to \r\nhospitalization\r\n[ ] Has missed HD sessions in the past leading to \r\nhospitalization, could benefit from further counseling\r\n[ ] Had visual hallucinations during alcohol withdrawal and is \r\nactively drinking, on repeat hospitalizations will be important \r\nto monitor for signs of withdrawal, she describes this as her \r\nfirst episode\r\n[ ] New prescription of rifaximin for patient, but at time of \r\ndischarge unclear if insurance will cover/if she needs prior \r\nauth, would recommend following up to see if patient is able to \r\nget medication\r\n[ ] Is taking baclofen for muscle spasms/aches, may be \r\ncontributing to her frequent hospitalizations for AMS, would \r\nconsider re-assessing if necessary in patient\r\n\r\nCODE: FCp\r\nCONTACT: ___ (son) ___ \r\n \r\nMedications on Admission:\r\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\r\n1.

The patient required 2u pRBCs for low Hgb \r\nin the ED and was noted to be lethargic, her lactulose was \r\nincreased and she received HD and her mentation improved. She \r\nwas discharged AAOx3 in stable condition.\r\n\r\nACUTE ISSUES:\r\n=============\r\n#Hepatic encephalopathy\r\n#Uremic encephalopathy\r\n#AMS\r\nThe patient presented from her hemodialysis center to the ED w/ \r\nlethargy and a known recent fall down a flight of stairs. At the \r\ntime of presentation, she was noted to be lethargic but able to \r\nconverse without difficulty. Upon arrival to the floor, she \r\nremained lethargic but arousable to voice and able to follow \r\ncommands. She described not taking her lactulose recently, \r\nmissing a session of HD as a result of her lethargy, and recent \r\nalcohol use. HE, uremic encephalopathy, and alcohol use were all \r\nconsidered as etiologies for her AMS. She was given lactulose at \r\nan increased rate and had runs of HD on back-to-back days. Her \r\nmentation improved to baseline, AAOx3, and she was returned to \r\nher usual lactulose dose and TTS HD schedule at time of \r\ndischarge.\r\n\r\n#Alcoholic hallucinosis\r\nOn day two of her hospitalization the patient described a \r\nhallucination in which a man was standing over her and repeating \r\nher name, ___ She was frightened and unwilling to open her \r\neyes. This was concerning for alcoholic hallucinosis given the \r\ntime frame and her recent alcohol use, so she was placed on CIWA \r\nprotocol w/ lorazepam for management. By day three, her \r\nhallucinations had ceased and at time of discharge she was out \r\nof the alcohol withdrawal window.\r\n\r\n#Acute on chronic blood loss anemia\r\nAt admission to the ED, the patient was noted to have a Hgb <7, \r\nso she was given 2u pRBCs, to which she bumped appropriately. \r\nShe has a history of esophageal varices so she was monitored \r\nwith daily CBCs and her Hgb remained > 7 for the rest of her \r\nstay. She had no evidence of blood loss (no melena, hematemesis, \r\nBRBPR) throughout her hospitalization. Given her recent fall, a \r\nCT was ordered to assess for an RP bleed but was negative.\r\n\r\n#Fall ___ alcohol use\r\nThe patient states that she had been drinking and was exiting \r\nher closet at which point she fell down a flight of stairs. On \r\nadmission, she had ecchymoses on her arms, legs, and scalp. CT \r\nhead negative for intracranial hemorrhage, CT c-spine negative, \r\nand shoulder XR normal. She saw ___ while inpatient who \r\nrecommended further ___ while outpatient, for which patient \r\nalready has ___ services.\r\n\r\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\r\n===============\r\n#Alcoholic cirrhosis\r\nPatient was monitored for signs of GI bleeds, but no evidence. \r\nShe was started on rifaximin. Otherwise monitored daily MELD \r\nlabs.\r\n\r\n#ESRD on HD\r\nDue to concern for uremic encephalopathy, was given HD on two \r\nconsecutive days, then transitioned to home TTS schedule prior \r\nto discharge.\r\n\r\n#Alcohol use disorder\r\nPatient met with social work but stated she does not wish to \r\nstop drinking at this time. Was given resources for relapse \r\nprevention.\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n====================\r\n[ ] Discharge Cr 5.3\r\n[ ] Discharge AST/ALT ___\r\n[ ] Discharge T bili \r\n[ ] Discharge Hgb 7.3\r\n[ ] Patient continues to drink alcohol and would benefit from \r\ntherapy, was given resources from Psychology Today for \r\nclinicians in ___ area that take her insurance and have \r\nexperience in addiction counseling\r\n[ ] Would benefit from further ___ given recent fall\r\n[ ] Weekly CBC and may benefit as an outpatient from scheduled \r\ntransfusions, likely has chronic low volume blood loss from GI \r\nsource leading to anemia\r\n[ ] Would benefit from follow-up on whether she is taking \r\nlactulose, has history of non-compliance leading to \r\nhospitalization\r\n[ ] Has missed HD sessions in the past leading to \r\nhospitalization, could benefit from further counseling\r\n[ ] Had visual hallucinations during alcohol withdrawal and is \r\nactively drinking, on repeat hospitalizations will be important \r\nto monitor for signs of withdrawal, she describes this as her \r\nfirst episode\r\n[ ] New prescription of rifaximin for patient, but at time of \r\ndischarge unclear if insurance will cover/if she needs prior \r\nauth, would recommend following up to see if patient is able to \r\nget medication\r\n[ ] Is taking baclofen for muscle spasms/aches, may be \r\ncontributing to her frequent hospitalizations for AMS, would \r\nconsider re-assessing if necessary in patient\r\n\r\nCODE: FCp\r\nCONTACT: ___ (son) ___ \r\n \r\nMedications on Admission:\r\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\r\n1.

The AMS is likely multi-factorial including \r\nlethargy from dialysis, recent excessive etoh intake, and \r\nnon-compliance with lactulose. Specifically, she reports not \r\ntaking lactulose for several months due to it causing diarrhea, \r\ntherefore, she may only need 1x dosing a day. Her mental status \r\ncompletely improved the day after admission. The patient was \r\nencouraged to stop drinking and educated on the importance of \r\ntaking lactulose and rifaximin. The patient is unaware of the \r\nmedications she is taking and would benefit from close follow \r\nup. We discharged her with some medications to bedside. Please \r\nsee below for more information\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n====================\r\n\r\nMED CHANGES\r\n[] Gave the patient four tiny bottles of lactulose and \r\ninstructed her to use it if she or her son was concerned about \r\nconfusion. Also filled rifaximin\r\n[] Filled Advair prescription for asthma. Unclear if she is \r\nusing inhaler and would likely benefit from getting a rescue \r\ninhaler as well\r\n[] Filled baclofen that she takes for back pain (tiny dose) but \r\nthis may be a deliriogenic that should be avoid in the future if \r\nshe has recurrent confusion\r\n[] Gave the patient folic acid and thiamine given concern for \r\nmalnutrition and Wernickes during previous hospitalization\r\n[] It was too soon to fill her levothyroxine. She states she has \r\nit at home. \r\n[] It was too soon to fill midodrine and dialysis vitamins\r\n[] Continued Alcohol Cessation Counseling\r\n[] Encourage cessation of tobacco\r\n\r\n--Discharge Hgb 8.5\r\n--Discharge weight 166 lbs\r\n\r\nACTIVE ISSUES\r\n=============\r\n# Encephalopathy\r\nMultifactorial with most important factor likely hepatic \r\nencephalopathy. Patient and son confirm that she has not taken \r\nher lactulose for ~ 1 month, had drank a marked amount of \r\nalcohol the night prior. Has hx of concern for wernicke's \r\nencephalopathy and prior admissions for alcoholic hallucinosis \r\nbut no signs of withdrawal this admission. Treated predominantly \r\nwith lactulose with recovery of mental status and folate and \r\nthiamine by mouth.  \r\n\r\n#Alcohol use disorder\r\nPatient met with social work on last hospitalization but stated \r\nshe does not wish to stop drinking at this time. Was given \r\nresources for relapse  prevention. This admission she states \r\nthat she has a social worker already and not interested in \r\nanother consultation. Patient received thiamine, MV, and folate. \r\nShe was monitored for signs of withdrawal but did not require \r\ntreatment. \r\n\r\n#Etoh Cirrhosis\r\nHistory of etoh cirrhosis with continued etoh intake.

Echogenic kidneys which can be seen with chronic medical \r\nrenal disease. \r\n\r\n \r\nBrief Hospital Course:\r\nPATIENT SUMMARY\r\n===================\r\nMs. ___ is a ___ yo F with hx of EtOH cirrhosis complicated by \r\nesophageal varices s/p recent banding (___), stomach ulcer, \r\nESRD on HD, HTN, asthma who presented with altered mental status \r\nfrom dialysis. The AMS is likely multi-factorial including \r\nlethargy from dialysis, recent excessive etoh intake, and \r\nnon-compliance with lactulose. Specifically, she reports not \r\ntaking lactulose for several months due to it causing diarrhea, \r\ntherefore, she may only need 1x dosing a day. Her mental status \r\ncompletely improved the day after admission. The patient was \r\nencouraged to stop drinking and educated on the importance of \r\ntaking lactulose and rifaximin. The patient is unaware of the \r\nmedications she is taking and would benefit from close follow \r\nup. We discharged her with some medications to bedside. Please \r\nsee below for more information\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n====================\r\n\r\nMED CHANGES\r\n[] Gave the patient four tiny bottles of lactulose and \r\ninstructed her to use it if she or her son was concerned about \r\nconfusion. Also filled rifaximin\r\n[] Filled Advair prescription for asthma. Unclear if she is \r\nusing inhaler and would likely benefit from getting a rescue \r\ninhaler as well\r\n[] Filled baclofen that she takes for back pain (tiny dose) but \r\nthis may be a deliriogenic that should be avoid in the future if \r\nshe has recurrent confusion\r\n[] Gave the patient folic acid and thiamine given concern for \r\nmalnutrition and Wernickes during previous hospitalization\r\n[] It was too soon to fill her levothyroxine. She states she has \r\nit at home. \r\n[] It was too soon to fill midodrine and dialysis vitamins\r\n[] Continued Alcohol Cessation Counseling\r\n[] Encourage cessation of tobacco\r\n\r\n--Discharge Hgb 8.5\r\n--Discharge weight 166 lbs\r\n\r\nACTIVE ISSUES\r\n=============\r\n# Encephalopathy\r\nMultifactorial with most important factor likely hepatic \r\nencephalopathy. Patient and son confirm that she has not taken \r\nher lactulose for ~ 1 month, had drank a marked amount of \r\nalcohol the night prior. Has hx of concern for wernicke's \r\nencephalopathy and prior admissions for alcoholic hallucinosis \r\nbut no signs of withdrawal this admission. Treated predominantly \r\nwith lactulose with recovery of mental status and folate and \r\nthiamine by mouth.  \r\n\r\n#Alcohol use disorder\r\nPatient met with social work on last hospitalization but stated \r\nshe does not wish to stop drinking at this time. Was given \r\nresources for relapse  prevention. This admission she states \r\nthat she has a social worker already and not interested in \r\nanother consultation. Patient received thiamine, MV, and folate. \r\nShe was monitored for signs of withdrawal but did not require \r\ntreatment. \r\n\r\n#Etoh Cirrhosis\r\nHistory of etoh cirrhosis with continued etoh intake.

The AMS is likely multi-factorial including \r\nlethargy from dialysis, recent excessive etoh intake, and \r\nnon-compliance with lactulose. Specifically, she reports not \r\ntaking lactulose for several months due to it causing diarrhea, \r\ntherefore, she may only need 1x dosing a day. Her mental status \r\ncompletely improved the day after admission. The patient was \r\nencouraged to stop drinking and educated on the importance of \r\ntaking lactulose and rifaximin. The patient is unaware of the \r\nmedications she is taking and would benefit from close follow \r\nup. We discharged her with some medications to bedside. Please \r\nsee below for more information\r\n\r\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\r\n====================\r\n\r\nMED CHANGES\r\n[] Gave the patient four tiny bottles of lactulose and \r\ninstructed her to use it if she or her son was concerned about \r\nconfusion. Also filled rifaximin\r\n[] Filled Advair prescription for asthma. Unclear if she is \r\nusing inhaler and would likely benefit from getting a rescue \r\ninhaler as well\r\n[] Filled baclofen that she takes for back pain (tiny dose) but \r\nthis may be a deliriogenic that should be avoid in the future if \r\nshe has recurrent confusion\r\n[] Gave the patient folic acid and thiamine given concern for \r\nmalnutrition and Wernickes during previous hospitalization\r\n[] It was too soon to fill her levothyroxine. She states she has \r\nit at home. \r\n[] It was too soon to fill midodrine and dialysis vitamins\r\n[] Continued Alcohol Cessation Counseling\r\n[] Encourage cessation of tobacco\r\n\r\n--Discharge Hgb 8.5\r\n--Discharge weight 166 lbs\r\n\r\nACTIVE ISSUES\r\n=============\r\n# Encephalopathy\r\nMultifactorial with most important factor likely hepatic \r\nencephalopathy. Patient and son confirm that she has not taken \r\nher lactulose for ~ 1 month, had drank a marked amount of \r\nalcohol the night prior. Has hx of concern for wernicke's \r\nencephalopathy and prior admissions for alcoholic hallucinosis \r\nbut no signs of withdrawal this admission. Treated predominantly \r\nwith lactulose with recovery of mental status and folate and \r\nthiamine by mouth.  \r\n\r\n#Alcohol use disorder\r\nPatient met with social work on last hospitalization but stated \r\nshe does not wish to stop drinking at this time. Was given \r\nresources for relapse  prevention. This admission she states \r\nthat she has a social worker already and not interested in \r\nanother consultation. Patient received thiamine, MV, and folate. \r\nShe was monitored for signs of withdrawal but did not require \r\ntreatment. \r\n\r\n#Etoh Cirrhosis\r\nHistory of etoh cirrhosis with continued etoh intake. MELD score \r\n21 Childs Class 6 on admission. Not a transplant candidate given \r\ncontinued etoh intake. \r\nVolume: no ascites on RUQUS, not discharged on diuretics and\r\ndenies taking at home\r\nInfection: see above\r\nBleed:  Hgb 10.4 on admit and last was 7.3. history\r\nof anemia requiring transfusions, last EGD in ___ s/p banding \r\nof varices. \r\nEncephalopathy: on home rifaximin, but was not taking lactulose, \r\ndischarged with lactulose PRN confusion\r\n\r\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\r\n======================\r\n#ESRD on iHD (___)\r\nMissed ___ dialysis as she was sent to ED.

There is mild septal deviation \r\nto the left. The aortia is of normal caliber. There is no \r\nlymphadenopathy. The major airways are patent. There are \r\ngrounglass opacities in the left upper lobe. There is no pleural \r\neffusion or pneumothorax. There is mild bibasilar subsegmental \r\natelectasis, scarring. \r\n\r\nImpression:\r\nPositive for pulmonary emboli with large clot burden.\r\nGrounglass opacities in the left upper lobe, nonspecific, may be \r\ninfectious/inflammatory or atypical pulmonary infarct.\r\n\r\nEcho ___:\r\nLeft ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global \r\nsystolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The right ventricular \r\ncavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility. There \r\nis abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right \r\nventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic root is mildly \r\ndilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly \r\nthickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic \r\nregurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly \r\nthickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within \r\nnormal limits). There is severe pulmonary artery systolic \r\nhypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. There is an \r\nanterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. \r\n\r\n\r\nIMPRESSION: Dilated, hypokinetic right ventricle with abnormal \r\nseptal motion suggestive of right ventricular pressure/volume \r\noverload (e.g. primary pulmonary process such as PE or COPD). \r\nMildly dilated aortic root. Severe pulmonary artery systolic \r\nhypertension.\r\n\r\nLower extremity Doppler US:\r\nLeft deep venous thrombus within the proximal femoral vein \r\nextending to \r\nthe popliteal vein, nonocclusive.

Vascular surgery evaluation at \r\nthat time was determined not to be surgical candidate. He was \r\nrecommended to be transferred to ___ for toe amputation by \r\npodiatry. Upon his arrival to ___, he was seen by podiatry and \r\nwas recommended for toe amputation. Was started on vanc, cipro, \r\nand flagyl. Given his chronic clot history, medicine wanted to \r\nreassess whether he would be a good candidate for \r\nrevascularization and possibly bypass. Vascular was consulted \r\nand recommended angiogram, arterial duplex studies, as well as \r\nvenous mapping studies to assess graftable vessels in the legs. \r\nAngiogram was performed and showed left popliteal artery \r\nocclusion. He was taken to the OR on ___ for ___ bypass as \r\nwell as ___ left toe amputation; There were no complications and \r\nthe patient tolerated the procedure. Patient was deemed stable \r\nfor discharge to home with services on ___\r\n\r\n# Cardiac risk stratification: Given concern for chest pain on \r\nadmission, he required cardiac risk stratification in the \r\nsetting of chronic DVT and PE history. He underwent nuclear \r\nstress test, which showed normal myocardial perfusion and normal \r\nleft ventricular cavity size and\r\nsystolic function. No anginal symptoms or ST changes. He may \r\nproceed to surgery without additional cardiac imaging or workup. \r\nHe is at intermediate risk for an intermediate to low risk \r\nprocedure.\r\n\r\n# History of recurrent DVT/PE\r\n# Protein C deficiency\r\nPt with hypercoagulable history, INR goal for OR <2.0 (1.2 this\r\nAM)\r\n- continue heparin gtt until OR\r\n\r\nCHRONIC/RESOLVED ISSUES:\r\n===============\r\n# ST segment elevation \r\n# New RBBB\r\nS/p normal nuclear stress test.

Vascular surgery evaluation at \r\nthat time was determined not to be surgical candidate. He was \r\nrecommended to be transferred to ___ for toe amputation by \r\npodiatry. Upon his arrival to ___, he was seen by podiatry and \r\nwas recommended for toe amputation. Was started on vanc, cipro, \r\nand flagyl. Given his chronic clot history, medicine wanted to \r\nreassess whether he would be a good candidate for \r\nrevascularization and possibly bypass. Vascular was consulted \r\nand recommended angiogram, arterial duplex studies, as well as \r\nvenous mapping studies to assess graftable vessels in the legs. \r\nAngiogram was performed and showed left popliteal artery \r\nocclusion. He was taken to the OR on ___ for ___ bypass as \r\nwell as ___ left toe amputation; There were no complications and \r\nthe patient tolerated the procedure. Patient was deemed stable \r\nfor discharge to home with services on ___\r\n\r\n# Cardiac risk stratification: Given concern for chest pain on \r\nadmission, he required cardiac risk stratification in the \r\nsetting of chronic DVT and PE history. He underwent nuclear \r\nstress test, which showed normal myocardial perfusion and normal \r\nleft ventricular cavity size and\r\nsystolic function. No anginal symptoms or ST changes. He may \r\nproceed to surgery without additional cardiac imaging or workup. \r\nHe is at intermediate risk for an intermediate to low risk \r\nprocedure.\r\n\r\n# History of recurrent DVT/PE\r\n# Protein C deficiency\r\nPt with hypercoagulable history, INR goal for OR <2.0 (1.2 this\r\nAM)\r\n- continue heparin gtt until OR\r\n\r\nCHRONIC/RESOLVED ISSUES:\r\n===============\r\n# ST segment elevation \r\n# New RBBB\r\nS/p normal nuclear stress test.

Given his chronic clot history, medicine wanted to \r\nreassess whether he would be a good candidate for \r\nrevascularization and possibly bypass. Vascular was consulted \r\nand recommended angiogram, arterial duplex studies, as well as \r\nvenous mapping studies to assess graftable vessels in the legs. \r\nAngiogram was performed and showed left popliteal artery \r\nocclusion. He was taken to the OR on ___ for ___ bypass as \r\nwell as ___ left toe amputation; There were no complications and \r\nthe patient tolerated the procedure. Patient was deemed stable \r\nfor discharge to home with services on ___\r\n\r\n# Cardiac risk stratification: Given concern for chest pain on \r\nadmission, he required cardiac risk stratification in the \r\nsetting of chronic DVT and PE history. He underwent nuclear \r\nstress test, which showed normal myocardial perfusion and normal \r\nleft ventricular cavity size and\r\nsystolic function. No anginal symptoms or ST changes. He may \r\nproceed to surgery without additional cardiac imaging or workup. \r\nHe is at intermediate risk for an intermediate to low risk \r\nprocedure.\r\n\r\n# History of recurrent DVT/PE\r\n# Protein C deficiency\r\nPt with hypercoagulable history, INR goal for OR <2.0 (1.2 this\r\nAM)\r\n- continue heparin gtt until OR\r\n\r\nCHRONIC/RESOLVED ISSUES:\r\n===============\r\n# ST segment elevation \r\n# New RBBB\r\nS/p normal nuclear stress test.

He will need overlap of warfarin with enoxaparin until\r\nhis INR is therapeutic on two successive blood draws which are \r\nat\r\nleast 24 hours apart.\r\nHe expressed preference to follow-up with his outside hospital\r\nhematologist, with whom he has a new patient appointment\r\nscheduled in the next few weeks.  We strongly emphasized\r\nimportance of attending that follow-up appointment.\r\n- We will not recommend direct oral anticoagulants for this\r\ngentleman due to inability to monitor drug levels and history of\r\nrecurrent ___.\r\n- We will sign off for now.

He was previously on Coumadin \r\nbut was subtherapeutic and more recently on lovenox while that \r\nlevel was being adjusted.\r\nHematology was consulted and recommended a higher dose of \r\nlovenox 80 BID, followed by Coumadin after ___ weeks with a goal \r\nINR of 2.5-3.5. They suggested he follow up with his outpatient \r\nhematologist given this was the patient's preference. His right \r\nleg was wrapped with ace bandage and elevated. Edema was \r\nimproved and he was in minimal pain at the time of discharge. We \r\nsuggested he continue this at home for symptomatic comfort.\r\n\r\nHis blood sugars were also very high (300s) and his insulin \r\nregimen was adjusted to 20 lantus at night followed by 8 of \r\nnovolog with meals and additional novolog (sliding scale) 2 \r\nunits for every 50 mg/dL above 150 mg/dL.\r\n\r\nHis left leg (bypass) was not symptomatic though his pulse exam \r\nwas different from prior (weak Doppler signal at ___, faint \r\nsignal over graft) and as such an arterial duplex was obtained \r\ndemonstrating graft occlusion. We discussed that may require \r\nrevision depending on his symptoms, and that for now \r\nanticoagulation would be appropriate as his leg is not \r\nthreatened. He will see Dr. ___ in clinic next week for \r\nfurther discussion.\r\n\r\nThe full recommendations from hematology and \r\n___ services are reprinted here: \r\n\r\nHEMATOLOGY RECOMMENDATIONS (Dr. ___:\r\n- We agree with anticoagulation with IV heparin for now.  In \r\ncase\r\nthere are no vascular interventions planned, we would recommend\r\nswitching to subcutaneous enoxaparin at dose of 1 mg/kg every 12\r\nhours. We will recommend rounding off his dose to 80 mg every 12\r\nhours (rather than 70 mg).\r\n- We recommend anti-coagulation with only enoxaparin for the \r\nnext\r\n___ weeks and holding warfarin during this time period.\r\n- We recommend follow-up with his hematologist at ___ weeks\r\ninterval when he can be transitioned to warfarin for INR goal of\r\n2.5-3.5. He will need overlap of warfarin with enoxaparin until\r\nhis INR is therapeutic on two successive blood draws which are \r\nat\r\nleast 24 hours apart.\r\nHe expressed preference to follow-up with his outside hospital\r\nhematologist, with whom he has a new patient appointment\r\nscheduled in the next few weeks.  We strongly emphasized\r\nimportance of attending that follow-up appointment.\r\n- We will not recommend direct oral anticoagulants for this\r\ngentleman due to inability to monitor drug levels and history of\r\nrecurrent ___.\r\n- We will sign off for now. Please feel free to contact us with\r\nany questions or concerns.\r\n\r\nHe was also seen by the ___ service for \r\nuncontrolled blood sugars (in 300s). They recommended a new \r\nregimen:\r\n\r\n___ NOTE: \r\nIncrease to 20 units lantus q24 hours\r\nStart fixed dose Novolog 8 units with meals (hold if not eating)\r\nNovolog sliding scale, 2u per 50 mg/dL over 150mg/dL.\r\n\r\n \r\nDischarge Medications:\r\n1.  Acetaminophen 650 mg PO Q6H:PRN Pain - Mild  \r\n2.  Aspirin 81 mg PO DAILY  \r\n3.  Metoprolol Tartrate 25 mg PO BID  \r\n4.  Enoxaparin Sodium 80 mg SC Q12H  \r\n5.  Glargine 20 Units Bedtime\r\nnovolog 8 Units Breakfast\r\nnovolog 8 Units Lunch\r\nnovolog 8 Units Dinner \r\n6.  Atorvastatin 40 mg PO QPM  \r\n7.  Cyclobenzaprine 5 mg PO TID:PRN pain/spasms  \r\n8.  FLUoxetine 40 mg PO DAILY  \r\n9.  Gabapentin 600 mg PO BID  \r\n\r\n \r\nDischarge Disposition:\r\nHome\r\n \r\nDischarge Diagnosis:\r\nExtensive DVT right leg\r\nGraft thrombosis left bypass graft\r\n\r\n \r\nDischarge Condition:\r\nMental Status: Clear and coherent.\r\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.\r\nActivity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.\r\n\r\n \r\nDischarge Instructions:\r\nYou were admitted for pain and swelling in your right leg. This \r\nwas found to be due to a large clot in your deep vein (common \r\nfemoral) down to your calf veins. You were seen by the \r\nhematology service who recommended a higher dose of lovenox \r\n(enoxaparin) for increased blood thinning to treat this.\r\n\r\nYou were also suspected based on our physical exam to have a \r\nclot in your bypass graft on your left leg. This was confirmed \r\nbased on arterial ultrasound. This may ultimately need to be \r\ntreated or revised, but for now the lovenox (enoxaparin) is \r\noptimal for it to settle down some bit.\r\n \r\nFollowup Instructions:\r\n___\r\n"

He presented last \r\nmonth with lower extremity DVT as well as cellulitis and was \r\nplaced on anticoagulation, but ultimately developed additional \r\nDVTs and a pulmonary embolism with changes to his\r\nanticoagulation management.  He represented for management of \r\nthese issues as well as progressive left lower extremity rest \r\npain and nonhealing sites to his ___ toe amputation, which was \r\ndone last year.  Given this constellation of symptoms and lack\r\nof revascularization options, a decision was made to proceed \r\nwith a left lower extremity below knee amputation.  He was \r\namenable to that course.\r\n\r\nNeuro: Prior to admission, the patient reportedly took 30 mg of \r\noxycodone per day at home for chronic back pain. In addition, he \r\ntook gabapentin and cyclobenzaprine. Perioperatively, his pain \r\nregimen was increased to ___ mg of oxycodone q3h prn in \r\naddition to morphine for breakthrough pain, gabapentin, and \r\ncyclobenzaprine. This regimen kept his pain to a reasonable \r\nlevel after surgery. Prior to discharge, he was transitioned to \r\nPO dilaudid. The patient tolerated this medication well and it \r\nseemed to keep his pain under control. \r\nCV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular \r\nstandpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.\r\nVasc: The patient underwent a L BKA due to lack of \r\nrevascularization options and infection of the left lower \r\nextremity. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Please see \r\nthe operative report for further details. Post operatively, his \r\nincisions remained c/d/I. He worked with ___ and OT during this \r\nhospitalization. He remained in a knee immobilizer when \r\nappropriate. \r\nPulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary \r\nstandpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. \r\nGI/GU/FEN: The patient was initially kept NPO for the OR, and he \r\nwas subsequently advanced post operatively to a regular diabetic \r\ndiet that he tolerated well. \r\nEndocrine: The patient presented with a %HbA1c of 12.0. His \r\nblood sugars were difficult to control during this admission and \r\n___ was consulted and helped manage his \r\ninsulin regimen. \r\nID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs of \r\ninfection, of which there were none.\r\nHEME: The patient has a known history of protein C deficiency \r\nand recurrent ___. He arrived to the hospital with new occlusive \r\nthrombus within the left femoral and\r\npopliteal vein and unchanged completely occlusive thrombus \r\nthroughout the right common femoral, femoral and popliteal vein. \r\nHe developed this while on apixiban. Hematology was consulted \r\nand their recommendations of hep gtt pre operatively and \r\ntransitioning to lovenox afterwards were followed. I have copied \r\nthe hematology recommendations below: \r\n- We recommend anti-coagulation with only enoxaparin for atleast\r\nnext ___ weeks. Afterwards, we recommend either continuing with\r\nenoxaparin or bridging to warfarin with a goal INR of 2.5-3.5\r\nwith hematology follow up. He will need overlap of warfarin with\r\nenoxaparin until his INR is therapeutic on two successive blood\r\ndraws which are at least 24 hours apart.\r\nHe expressed preference to follow-up with his outside hospital\r\nhematologist.\r\n- We will not recommend direct oral anticoagulants for this\r\ngentleman due to inability to monitor drug levels, history of\r\nrecurrent ___, and new LLE DVT while on eliquis 5 mg BID.\r\n. \r\nProphylaxis: as detailed above\r\n\r\n \r\nMedications on Admission:\r\nThe Preadmission Medication list may be inaccurate and requires \r\nfuther investigation.\r\n1.

If \r\nthey are not, an appointment will be made for you to return for \r\nstaple removal. \r\n When the sutures are removed the doctor may or may not place \r\npieces of tape called steri-strips over the incision. These will \r\nstay on about a week and you may shower with them on. If these \r\ndo not fall off after 10 days, you may peel them off with warm \r\nwater and soap in the shower.\r\n\r\nCAUTIONS:\r\n If you smoke, please make every attempt to quit.

Afterwards, we recommend either continuing with\r\nenoxaparin or bridging to warfarin with a goal INR of 2.5-3.5\r\nwith hematology follow up. He will need overlap of warfarin with\r\nenoxaparin until his INR is therapeutic on two successive blood\r\ndraws which are at least 24 hours apart.\r\nHe expressed preference to follow-up with his outside hospital\r\nhematologist.\r\n- We will not recommend direct oral anticoagulants for this\r\ngentleman due to inability to monitor drug levels, history of\r\nrecurrent ___, and new LLE DVT while on eliquis 5 mg BID.\r\n\r\n \r\nFollowup Instructions:\r\n___\r\n"

He presented last \r\nmonth with lower extremity DVT as well as cellulitis and was \r\nplaced on anticoagulation, but ultimately developed additional \r\nDVTs and a pulmonary embolism with changes to his\r\nanticoagulation management.  He represented for management of \r\nthese issues as well as progressive left lower extremity rest \r\npain and nonhealing sites to his ___ toe amputation, which was \r\ndone last year.  Given this constellation of symptoms and lack\r\nof revascularization options, a decision was made to proceed \r\nwith a left lower extremity below knee amputation.  He was \r\namenable to that course.\r\n\r\nNeuro: Prior to admission, the patient reportedly took 30 mg of \r\noxycodone per day at home for chronic back pain. In addition, he \r\ntook gabapentin and cyclobenzaprine. Perioperatively, his pain \r\nregimen was increased to ___ mg of oxycodone q3h prn in \r\naddition to morphine for breakthrough pain, gabapentin, and \r\ncyclobenzaprine. This regimen kept his pain to a reasonable \r\nlevel after surgery. Prior to discharge, he was transitioned to \r\nPO dilaudid. The patient tolerated this medication well and it \r\nseemed to keep his pain under control. \r\nCV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular \r\nstandpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.\r\nVasc: The patient underwent a L BKA due to lack of \r\nrevascularization options and infection of the left lower \r\nextremity. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Please see \r\nthe operative report for further details. Post operatively, his \r\nincisions remained c/d/I. He worked with ___ and OT during this \r\nhospitalization. He remained in a knee immobilizer when \r\nappropriate. \r\nPulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary \r\nstandpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. \r\nGI/GU/FEN: The patient was initially kept NPO for the OR, and he \r\nwas subsequently advanced post operatively to a regular diabetic \r\ndiet that he tolerated well. \r\nEndocrine: The patient presented with a %HbA1c of 12.0. His \r\nblood sugars were difficult to control during this admission and \r\n___ was consulted and helped manage his \r\ninsulin regimen. \r\nID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs of \r\ninfection, of which there were none.\r\nHEME: The patient has a known history of protein C deficiency \r\nand recurrent ___. He arrived to the hospital with new occlusive \r\nthrombus within the left femoral and\r\npopliteal vein and unchanged completely occlusive thrombus \r\nthroughout the right common femoral, femoral and popliteal vein. \r\nHe developed this while on apixiban. Hematology was consulted \r\nand their recommendations of hep gtt pre operatively and \r\ntransitioning to lovenox afterwards were followed. I have copied \r\nthe hematology recommendations below: \r\n- We recommend anti-coagulation with only enoxaparin for atleast\r\nnext ___ weeks. Afterwards, we recommend either continuing with\r\nenoxaparin or bridging to warfarin with a goal INR of 2.5-3.5\r\nwith hematology follow up. He will need overlap of warfarin with\r\nenoxaparin until his INR is therapeutic on two successive blood\r\ndraws which are at least 24 hours apart.\r\nHe expressed preference to follow-up with his outside hospital\r\nhematologist.\r\n- We will not recommend direct oral anticoagulants for this\r\ngentleman due to inability to monitor drug levels, history of\r\nrecurrent ___, and new LLE DVT while on eliquis 5 mg BID.\r\n. \r\nProphylaxis: as detailed above\r\n\r\n \r\nMedications on Admission:\r\nThe Preadmission Medication list may be inaccurate and requires \r\nfuther investigation.\r\n1.

He presented last \r\nmonth with lower extremity DVT as well as cellulitis and was \r\nplaced on anticoagulation, but ultimately developed additional \r\nDVTs and a pulmonary embolism with changes to his\r\nanticoagulation management.  He represented for management of \r\nthese issues as well as progressive left lower extremity rest \r\npain and nonhealing sites to his ___ toe amputation, which was \r\ndone last year.  Given this constellation of symptoms and lack\r\nof revascularization options, a decision was made to proceed \r\nwith a left lower extremity below knee amputation.  He was \r\namenable to that course.\r\n\r\nNeuro: Prior to admission, the patient reportedly took 30 mg of \r\noxycodone per day at home for chronic back pain. In addition, he \r\ntook gabapentin and cyclobenzaprine. Perioperatively, his pain \r\nregimen was increased to ___ mg of oxycodone q3h prn in \r\naddition to morphine for breakthrough pain, gabapentin, and \r\ncyclobenzaprine. This regimen kept his pain to a reasonable \r\nlevel after surgery. Prior to discharge, he was transitioned to \r\nPO dilaudid. The patient tolerated this medication well and it \r\nseemed to keep his pain under control. \r\nCV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular \r\nstandpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.\r\nVasc: The patient underwent a L BKA due to lack of \r\nrevascularization options and infection of the left lower \r\nextremity. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Please see \r\nthe operative report for further details. Post operatively, his \r\nincisions remained c/d/I. He worked with ___ and OT during this \r\nhospitalization. He remained in a knee immobilizer when \r\nappropriate. \r\nPulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary \r\nstandpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. \r\nGI/GU/FEN: The patient was initially kept NPO for the OR, and he \r\nwas subsequently advanced post operatively to a regular diabetic \r\ndiet that he tolerated well. \r\nEndocrine: The patient presented with a %HbA1c of 12.0. His \r\nblood sugars were difficult to control during this admission and \r\n___ was consulted and helped manage his \r\ninsulin regimen. \r\nID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs of \r\ninfection, of which there were none.\r\nHEME: The patient has a known history of protein C deficiency \r\nand recurrent ___. He arrived to the hospital with new occlusive \r\nthrombus within the left femoral and\r\npopliteal vein and unchanged completely occlusive thrombus \r\nthroughout the right common femoral, femoral and popliteal vein. \r\nHe developed this while on apixiban. Hematology was consulted \r\nand their recommendations of hep gtt pre operatively and \r\ntransitioning to lovenox afterwards were followed. I have copied \r\nthe hematology recommendations below: \r\n- We recommend anti-coagulation with only enoxaparin for atleast\r\nnext ___ weeks. Afterwards, we recommend either continuing with\r\nenoxaparin or bridging to warfarin with a goal INR of 2.5-3.5\r\nwith hematology follow up. He will need overlap of warfarin with\r\nenoxaparin until his INR is therapeutic on two successive blood\r\ndraws which are at least 24 hours apart.\r\nHe expressed preference to follow-up with his outside hospital\r\nhematologist.\r\n- We will not recommend direct oral anticoagulants for this\r\ngentleman due to inability to monitor drug levels, history of\r\nrecurrent ___, and new LLE DVT while on eliquis 5 mg BID.\r\n. \r\nProphylaxis: as detailed above\r\n\r\n \r\nMedications on Admission:\r\nThe Preadmission Medication list may be inaccurate and requires \r\nfuther investigation.\r\n1.

In addition, you \r\nwere seen by the hematology team who recommended the appropriate \r\nmedications to help manage your blood clots. You have now \r\nrecovered from surgery and are ready to be discharged. Please \r\nfollow the instructions below to continue your recovery:\r\n\r\nACTIVITY: \r\n On the side of your amputation you are non weight bearing for \r\n___ weeks. \r\n You should keep this amputation site elevated when ever \r\npossible. \r\n You may use the opposite foot for transfers and pivots.\r\n No driving until cleared by your Surgeon.\r\n No heavy lifting greater than 20 pounds for the next 3 weeks. \r\n\r\nBATHING/SHOWERING: \r\n You may shower when you get home\r\n No tub baths or pools / do not soak your foot for 4 weeks from \r\nyour date of surgery \r\n\r\nWOUND CARE:\r\n Sutures / Staples may have been removed before discharge. If \r\nthey are not, an appointment will be made for you to return for \r\nstaple removal. \r\n When the sutures are removed the doctor may or may not place \r\npieces of tape called steri-strips over the incision.

He presented last \r\nmonth with lower extremity DVT as well as cellulitis and was \r\nplaced on anticoagulation, but ultimately developed additional \r\nDVTs and a pulmonary embolism with changes to his\r\nanticoagulation management.  He represented for management of \r\nthese issues as well as progressive left lower extremity rest \r\npain and nonhealing sites to his ___ toe amputation, which was \r\ndone last year.  Given this constellation of symptoms and lack\r\nof revascularization options, a decision was made to proceed \r\nwith a left lower extremity below knee amputation.  He was \r\namenable to that course.\r\n\r\nNeuro: Prior to admission, the patient reportedly took 30 mg of \r\noxycodone per day at home for chronic back pain. In addition, he \r\ntook gabapentin and cyclobenzaprine. Perioperatively, his pain \r\nregimen was increased to ___ mg of oxycodone q3h prn in \r\naddition to morphine for breakthrough pain, gabapentin, and \r\ncyclobenzaprine. This regimen kept his pain to a reasonable \r\nlevel after surgery. Prior to discharge, he was transitioned to \r\nPO dilaudid. The patient tolerated this medication well and it \r\nseemed to keep his pain under control. \r\nCV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular \r\nstandpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.\r\nVasc: The patient underwent a L BKA due to lack of \r\nrevascularization options and infection of the left lower \r\nextremity. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Please see \r\nthe operative report for further details. Post operatively, his \r\nincisions remained c/d/I. He worked with ___ and OT during this \r\nhospitalization. He remained in a knee immobilizer when \r\nappropriate. \r\nPulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary \r\nstandpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. \r\nGI/GU/FEN: The patient was initially kept NPO for the OR, and he \r\nwas subsequently advanced post operatively to a regular diabetic \r\ndiet that he tolerated well. \r\nEndocrine: The patient presented with a %HbA1c of 12.0. His \r\nblood sugars were difficult to control during this admission and \r\n___ was consulted and helped manage his \r\ninsulin regimen. \r\nID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs of \r\ninfection, of which there were none.\r\nHEME: The patient has a known history of protein C deficiency \r\nand recurrent ___. He arrived to the hospital with new occlusive \r\nthrombus within the left femoral and\r\npopliteal vein and unchanged completely occlusive thrombus \r\nthroughout the right common femoral, femoral and popliteal vein. \r\nHe developed this while on apixiban. Hematology was consulted \r\nand their recommendations of hep gtt pre operatively and \r\ntransitioning to lovenox afterwards were followed. I have copied \r\nthe hematology recommendations below: \r\n- We recommend anti-coagulation with only enoxaparin for atleast\r\nnext ___ weeks. Afterwards, we recommend either continuing with\r\nenoxaparin or bridging to warfarin with a goal INR of 2.5-3.5\r\nwith hematology follow up. He will need overlap of warfarin with\r\nenoxaparin until his INR is therapeutic on two successive blood\r\ndraws which are at least 24 hours apart.\r\nHe expressed preference to follow-up with his outside hospital\r\nhematologist.\r\n- We will not recommend direct oral anticoagulants for this\r\ngentleman due to inability to monitor drug levels, history of\r\nrecurrent ___, and new LLE DVT while on eliquis 5 mg BID.\r\n. \r\nProphylaxis: as detailed above\r\n\r\n \r\nMedications on Admission:\r\nThe Preadmission Medication list may be inaccurate and requires \r\nfuther investigation.\r\n1.

In addition, you \r\nwere seen by the hematology team who recommended the appropriate \r\nmedications to help manage your blood clots. You have now \r\nrecovered from surgery and are ready to be discharged. Please \r\nfollow the instructions below to continue your recovery:\r\n\r\nACTIVITY: \r\n On the side of your amputation you are non weight bearing for \r\n___ weeks. \r\n You should keep this amputation site elevated when ever \r\npossible. \r\n You may use the opposite foot for transfers and pivots.\r\n No driving until cleared by your Surgeon.\r\n No heavy lifting greater than 20 pounds for the next 3 weeks. \r\n\r\nBATHING/SHOWERING: \r\n You may shower when you get home\r\n No tub baths or pools / do not soak your foot for 4 weeks from \r\nyour date of surgery \r\n\r\nWOUND CARE:\r\n Sutures / Staples may have been removed before discharge. If \r\nthey are not, an appointment will be made for you to return for \r\nstaple removal. \r\n When the sutures are removed the doctor may or may not place \r\npieces of tape called steri-strips over the incision.

He presented last \r\nmonth with lower extremity DVT as well as cellulitis and was \r\nplaced on anticoagulation, but ultimately developed additional \r\nDVTs and a pulmonary embolism with changes to his\r\nanticoagulation management.  He represented for management of \r\nthese issues as well as progressive left lower extremity rest \r\npain and nonhealing sites to his ___ toe amputation, which was \r\ndone last year.  Given this constellation of symptoms and lack\r\nof revascularization options, a decision was made to proceed \r\nwith a left lower extremity below knee amputation.  He was \r\namenable to that course.\r\n\r\nNeuro: Prior to admission, the patient reportedly took 30 mg of \r\noxycodone per day at home for chronic back pain. In addition, he \r\ntook gabapentin and cyclobenzaprine. Perioperatively, his pain \r\nregimen was increased to ___ mg of oxycodone q3h prn in \r\naddition to morphine for breakthrough pain, gabapentin, and \r\ncyclobenzaprine. This regimen kept his pain to a reasonable \r\nlevel after surgery. Prior to discharge, he was transitioned to \r\nPO dilaudid. The patient tolerated this medication well and it \r\nseemed to keep his pain under control. \r\nCV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular \r\nstandpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.\r\nVasc: The patient underwent a L BKA due to lack of \r\nrevascularization options and infection of the left lower \r\nextremity. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Please see \r\nthe operative report for further details. Post operatively, his \r\nincisions remained c/d/I. He worked with ___ and OT during this \r\nhospitalization. He remained in a knee immobilizer when \r\nappropriate. \r\nPulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary \r\nstandpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. \r\nGI/GU/FEN: The patient was initially kept NPO for the OR, and he \r\nwas subsequently advanced post operatively to a regular diabetic \r\ndiet that he tolerated well. \r\nEndocrine: The patient presented with a %HbA1c of 12.0. His \r\nblood sugars were difficult to control during this admission and \r\n___ was consulted and helped manage his \r\ninsulin regimen. \r\nID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs of \r\ninfection, of which there were none.\r\nHEME: The patient has a known history of protein C deficiency \r\nand recurrent ___. He arrived to the hospital with new occlusive \r\nthrombus within the left femoral and\r\npopliteal vein and unchanged completely occlusive thrombus \r\nthroughout the right common femoral, femoral and popliteal vein. \r\nHe developed this while on apixiban. Hematology was consulted \r\nand their recommendations of hep gtt pre operatively and \r\ntransitioning to lovenox afterwards were followed. I have copied \r\nthe hematology recommendations below: \r\n- We recommend anti-coagulation with only enoxaparin for atleast\r\nnext ___ weeks. Afterwards, we recommend either continuing with\r\nenoxaparin or bridging to warfarin with a goal INR of 2.5-3.5\r\nwith hematology follow up. He will need overlap of warfarin with\r\nenoxaparin until his INR is therapeutic on two successive blood\r\ndraws which are at least 24 hours apart.\r\nHe expressed preference to follow-up with his outside hospital\r\nhematologist.\r\n- We will not recommend direct oral anticoagulants for this\r\ngentleman due to inability to monitor drug levels, history of\r\nrecurrent ___, and new LLE DVT while on eliquis 5 mg BID.\r\n. \r\nProphylaxis: as detailed above\r\n\r\n \r\nMedications on Admission:\r\nThe Preadmission Medication list may be inaccurate and requires \r\nfuther investigation.\r\n1.

In addition, you \r\nwere seen by the hematology team who recommended the appropriate \r\nmedications to help manage your blood clots. You have now \r\nrecovered from surgery and are ready to be discharged. Please \r\nfollow the instructions below to continue your recovery:\r\n\r\nACTIVITY: \r\n On the side of your amputation you are non weight bearing for \r\n___ weeks. \r\n You should keep this amputation site elevated when ever \r\npossible. \r\n You may use the opposite foot for transfers and pivots.\r\n No driving until cleared by your Surgeon.\r\n No heavy lifting greater than 20 pounds for the next 3 weeks. \r\n\r\nBATHING/SHOWERING: \r\n You may shower when you get home\r\n No tub baths or pools / do not soak your foot for 4 weeks from \r\nyour date of surgery \r\n\r\nWOUND CARE:\r\n Sutures / Staples may have been removed before discharge. If \r\nthey are not, an appointment will be made for you to return for \r\nstaple removal. \r\n When the sutures are removed the doctor may or may not place \r\npieces of tape called steri-strips over the incision.

He presented last \r\nmonth with lower extremity DVT as well as cellulitis and was \r\nplaced on anticoagulation, but ultimately developed additional \r\nDVTs and a pulmonary embolism with changes to his\r\nanticoagulation management.  He represented for management of \r\nthese issues as well as progressive left lower extremity rest \r\npain and nonhealing sites to his ___ toe amputation, which was \r\ndone last year.  Given this constellation of symptoms and lack\r\nof revascularization options, a decision was made to proceed \r\nwith a left lower extremity below knee amputation.  He was \r\namenable to that course.\r\n\r\nNeuro: Prior to admission, the patient reportedly took 30 mg of \r\noxycodone per day at home for chronic back pain. In addition, he \r\ntook gabapentin and cyclobenzaprine. Perioperatively, his pain \r\nregimen was increased to ___ mg of oxycodone q3h prn in \r\naddition to morphine for breakthrough pain, gabapentin, and \r\ncyclobenzaprine. This regimen kept his pain to a reasonable \r\nlevel after surgery. Prior to discharge, he was transitioned to \r\nPO dilaudid. The patient tolerated this medication well and it \r\nseemed to keep his pain under control. \r\nCV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular \r\nstandpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.\r\nVasc: The patient underwent a L BKA due to lack of \r\nrevascularization options and infection of the left lower \r\nextremity. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Please see \r\nthe operative report for further details. Post operatively, his \r\nincisions remained c/d/I. He worked with ___ and OT during this \r\nhospitalization. He remained in a knee immobilizer when \r\nappropriate. \r\nPulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary \r\nstandpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. \r\nGI/GU/FEN: The patient was initially kept NPO for the OR, and he \r\nwas subsequently advanced post operatively to a regular diabetic \r\ndiet that he tolerated well. \r\nEndocrine: The patient presented with a %HbA1c of 12.0. His \r\nblood sugars were difficult to control during this admission and \r\n___ was consulted and helped manage his \r\ninsulin regimen. \r\nID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs of \r\ninfection, of which there were none.\r\nHEME: The patient has a known history of protein C deficiency \r\nand recurrent ___. He arrived to the hospital with new occlusive \r\nthrombus within the left femoral and\r\npopliteal vein and unchanged completely occlusive thrombus \r\nthroughout the right common femoral, femoral and popliteal vein. \r\nHe developed this while on apixiban. Hematology was consulted \r\nand their recommendations of hep gtt pre operatively and \r\ntransitioning to lovenox afterwards were followed. I have copied \r\nthe hematology recommendations below: \r\n- We recommend anti-coagulation with only enoxaparin for atleast\r\nnext ___ weeks. Afterwards, we recommend either continuing with\r\nenoxaparin or bridging to warfarin with a goal INR of 2.5-3.5\r\nwith hematology follow up. He will need overlap of warfarin with\r\nenoxaparin until his INR is therapeutic on two successive blood\r\ndraws which are at least 24 hours apart.\r\nHe expressed preference to follow-up with his outside hospital\r\nhematologist.\r\n- We will not recommend direct oral anticoagulants for this\r\ngentleman due to inability to monitor drug levels, history of\r\nrecurrent ___, and new LLE DVT while on eliquis 5 mg BID.\r\n. \r\nProphylaxis: as detailed above\r\n\r\n \r\nMedications on Admission:\r\nThe Preadmission Medication list may be inaccurate and requires \r\nfuther investigation.\r\n1.

In addition, you \r\nwere seen by the hematology team who recommended the appropriate \r\nmedications to help manage your blood clots. You have now \r\nrecovered from surgery and are ready to be discharged. Please \r\nfollow the instructions below to continue your recovery:\r\n\r\nACTIVITY: \r\n On the side of your amputation you are non weight bearing for \r\n___ weeks. \r\n You should keep this amputation site elevated when ever \r\npossible. \r\n You may use the opposite foot for transfers and pivots.\r\n No driving until cleared by your Surgeon.\r\n No heavy lifting greater than 20 pounds for the next 3 weeks. \r\n\r\nBATHING/SHOWERING: \r\n You may shower when you get home\r\n No tub baths or pools / do not soak your foot for 4 weeks from \r\nyour date of surgery \r\n\r\nWOUND CARE:\r\n Sutures / Staples may have been removed before discharge. If \r\nthey are not, an appointment will be made for you to return for \r\nstaple removal. \r\n When the sutures are removed the doctor may or may not place \r\npieces of tape called steri-strips over the incision.

He presented last \r\nmonth with lower extremity DVT as well as cellulitis and was \r\nplaced on anticoagulation, but ultimately developed additional \r\nDVTs and a pulmonary embolism with changes to his\r\nanticoagulation management.  He represented for management of \r\nthese issues as well as progressive left lower extremity rest \r\npain and nonhealing sites to his ___ toe amputation, which was \r\ndone last year.  Given this constellation of symptoms and lack\r\nof revascularization options, a decision was made to proceed \r\nwith a left lower extremity below knee amputation.  He was \r\namenable to that course.\r\n\r\nNeuro: Prior to admission, the patient reportedly took 30 mg of \r\noxycodone per day at home for chronic back pain. In addition, he \r\ntook gabapentin and cyclobenzaprine. Perioperatively, his pain \r\nregimen was increased to ___ mg of oxycodone q3h prn in \r\naddition to morphine for breakthrough pain, gabapentin, and \r\ncyclobenzaprine. This regimen kept his pain to a reasonable \r\nlevel after surgery. Prior to discharge, he was transitioned to \r\nPO dilaudid. The patient tolerated this medication well and it \r\nseemed to keep his pain under control. \r\nCV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular \r\nstandpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.\r\nVasc: The patient underwent a L BKA due to lack of \r\nrevascularization options and infection of the left lower \r\nextremity. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Please see \r\nthe operative report for further details. Post operatively, his \r\nincisions remained c/d/I. He worked with ___ and OT during this \r\nhospitalization. He remained in a knee immobilizer when \r\nappropriate. \r\nPulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary \r\nstandpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. \r\nGI/GU/FEN: The patient was initially kept NPO for the OR, and he \r\nwas subsequently advanced post operatively to a regular diabetic \r\ndiet that he tolerated well. \r\nEndocrine: The patient presented with a %HbA1c of 12.0. His \r\nblood sugars were difficult to control during this admission and \r\n___ was consulted and helped manage his \r\ninsulin regimen. \r\nID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs of \r\ninfection, of which there were none.\r\nHEME: The patient has a known history of protein C deficiency \r\nand recurrent ___. He arrived to the hospital with new occlusive \r\nthrombus within the left femoral and\r\npopliteal vein and unchanged completely occlusive thrombus \r\nthroughout the right common femoral, femoral and popliteal vein. \r\nHe developed this while on apixiban. Hematology was consulted \r\nand their recommendations of hep gtt pre operatively and \r\ntransitioning to lovenox afterwards were followed. I have copied \r\nthe hematology recommendations below: \r\n- We recommend anti-coagulation with only enoxaparin for atleast\r\nnext ___ weeks. Afterwards, we recommend either continuing with\r\nenoxaparin or bridging to warfarin with a goal INR of 2.5-3.5\r\nwith hematology follow up. He will need overlap of warfarin with\r\nenoxaparin until his INR is therapeutic on two successive blood\r\ndraws which are at least 24 hours apart.\r\nHe expressed preference to follow-up with his outside hospital\r\nhematologist.\r\n- We will not recommend direct oral anticoagulants for this\r\ngentleman due to inability to monitor drug levels, history of\r\nrecurrent ___, and new LLE DVT while on eliquis 5 mg BID.\r\n. \r\nProphylaxis: as detailed above\r\n\r\n \r\nMedications on Admission:\r\nThe Preadmission Medication list may be inaccurate and requires \r\nfuther investigation.\r\n1.

In addition, you \r\nwere seen by the hematology team who recommended the appropriate \r\nmedications to help manage your blood clots. You have now \r\nrecovered from surgery and are ready to be discharged. Please \r\nfollow the instructions below to continue your recovery:\r\n\r\nACTIVITY: \r\n On the side of your amputation you are non weight bearing for \r\n___ weeks. \r\n You should keep this amputation site elevated when ever \r\npossible. \r\n You may use the opposite foot for transfers and pivots.\r\n No driving until cleared by your Surgeon.\r\n No heavy lifting greater than 20 pounds for the next 3 weeks. \r\n\r\nBATHING/SHOWERING: \r\n You may shower when you get home\r\n No tub baths or pools / do not soak your foot for 4 weeks from \r\nyour date of surgery \r\n\r\nWOUND CARE:\r\n Sutures / Staples may have been removed before discharge. If \r\nthey are not, an appointment will be made for you to return for \r\nstaple removal. \r\n When the sutures are removed the doctor may or may not place \r\npieces of tape called steri-strips over the incision.

He presented last \r\nmonth with lower extremity DVT as well as cellulitis and was \r\nplaced on anticoagulation, but ultimately developed additional \r\nDVTs and a pulmonary embolism with changes to his\r\nanticoagulation management.  He represented for management of \r\nthese issues as well as progressive left lower extremity rest \r\npain and nonhealing sites to his ___ toe amputation, which was \r\ndone last year.  Given this constellation of symptoms and lack\r\nof revascularization options, a decision was made to proceed \r\nwith a left lower extremity below knee amputation.  He was \r\namenable to that course.\r\n\r\nNeuro: Prior to admission, the patient reportedly took 30 mg of \r\noxycodone per day at home for chronic back pain. In addition, he \r\ntook gabapentin and cyclobenzaprine. Perioperatively, his pain \r\nregimen was increased to ___ mg of oxycodone q3h prn in \r\naddition to morphine for breakthrough pain, gabapentin, and \r\ncyclobenzaprine. This regimen kept his pain to a reasonable \r\nlevel after surgery. Prior to discharge, he was transitioned to \r\nPO dilaudid. The patient tolerated this medication well and it \r\nseemed to keep his pain under control. \r\nCV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular \r\nstandpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.\r\nVasc: The patient underwent a L BKA due to lack of \r\nrevascularization options and infection of the left lower \r\nextremity. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Please see \r\nthe operative report for further details. Post operatively, his \r\nincisions remained c/d/I. He worked with ___ and OT during this \r\nhospitalization. He remained in a knee immobilizer when \r\nappropriate. \r\nPulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary \r\nstandpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. \r\nGI/GU/FEN: The patient was initially kept NPO for the OR, and he \r\nwas subsequently advanced post operatively to a regular diabetic \r\ndiet that he tolerated well. \r\nEndocrine: The patient presented with a %HbA1c of 12.0. His \r\nblood sugars were difficult to control during this admission and \r\n___ was consulted and helped manage his \r\ninsulin regimen. \r\nID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs of \r\ninfection, of which there were none.\r\nHEME: The patient has a known history of protein C deficiency \r\nand recurrent ___. He arrived to the hospital with new occlusive \r\nthrombus within the left femoral and\r\npopliteal vein and unchanged completely occlusive thrombus \r\nthroughout the right common femoral, femoral and popliteal vein. \r\nHe developed this while on apixiban. Hematology was consulted \r\nand their recommendations of hep gtt pre operatively and \r\ntransitioning to lovenox afterwards were followed. I have copied \r\nthe hematology recommendations below: \r\n- We recommend anti-coagulation with only enoxaparin for atleast\r\nnext ___ weeks. Afterwards, we recommend either continuing with\r\nenoxaparin or bridging to warfarin with a goal INR of 2.5-3.5\r\nwith hematology follow up. He will need overlap of warfarin with\r\nenoxaparin until his INR is therapeutic on two successive blood\r\ndraws which are at least 24 hours apart.\r\nHe expressed preference to follow-up with his outside hospital\r\nhematologist.\r\n- We will not recommend direct oral anticoagulants for this\r\ngentleman due to inability to monitor drug levels, history of\r\nrecurrent ___, and new LLE DVT while on eliquis 5 mg BID.\r\n. \r\nProphylaxis: as detailed above\r\n\r\n \r\nMedications on Admission:\r\nThe Preadmission Medication list may be inaccurate and requires \r\nfuther investigation.\r\n1.

He presented last \r\nmonth with lower extremity DVT as well as cellulitis and was \r\nplaced on anticoagulation, but ultimately developed additional \r\nDVTs and a pulmonary embolism with changes to his\r\nanticoagulation management.  He represented for management of \r\nthese issues as well as progressive left lower extremity rest \r\npain and nonhealing sites to his ___ toe amputation, which was \r\ndone last year.  Given this constellation of symptoms and lack\r\nof revascularization options, a decision was made to proceed \r\nwith a left lower extremity below knee amputation.  He was \r\namenable to that course.\r\n\r\nNeuro: Prior to admission, the patient reportedly took 30 mg of \r\noxycodone per day at home for chronic back pain. In addition, he \r\ntook gabapentin and cyclobenzaprine. Perioperatively, his pain \r\nregimen was increased to ___ mg of oxycodone q3h prn in \r\naddition to morphine for breakthrough pain, gabapentin, and \r\ncyclobenzaprine. This regimen kept his pain to a reasonable \r\nlevel after surgery. Prior to discharge, he was transitioned to \r\nPO dilaudid. The patient tolerated this medication well and it \r\nseemed to keep his pain under control. \r\nCV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular \r\nstandpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.\r\nVasc: The patient underwent a L BKA due to lack of \r\nrevascularization options and infection of the left lower \r\nextremity. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Please see \r\nthe operative report for further details. Post operatively, his \r\nincisions remained c/d/I. He worked with ___ and OT during this \r\nhospitalization. He remained in a knee immobilizer when \r\nappropriate. \r\nPulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary \r\nstandpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. \r\nGI/GU/FEN: The patient was initially kept NPO for the OR, and he \r\nwas subsequently advanced post operatively to a regular diabetic \r\ndiet that he tolerated well. \r\nEndocrine: The patient presented with a %HbA1c of 12.0. His \r\nblood sugars were difficult to control during this admission and \r\n___ was consulted and helped manage his \r\ninsulin regimen. \r\nID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs of \r\ninfection, of which there were none.\r\nHEME: The patient has a known history of protein C deficiency \r\nand recurrent ___. He arrived to the hospital with new occlusive \r\nthrombus within the left femoral and\r\npopliteal vein and unchanged completely occlusive thrombus \r\nthroughout the right common femoral, femoral and popliteal vein. \r\nHe developed this while on apixiban. Hematology was consulted \r\nand their recommendations of hep gtt pre operatively and \r\ntransitioning to lovenox afterwards were followed. I have copied \r\nthe hematology recommendations below: \r\n- We recommend anti-coagulation with only enoxaparin for atleast\r\nnext ___ weeks. Afterwards, we recommend either continuing with\r\nenoxaparin or bridging to warfarin with a goal INR of 2.5-3.5\r\nwith hematology follow up. He will need overlap of warfarin with\r\nenoxaparin until his INR is therapeutic on two successive blood\r\ndraws which are at least 24 hours apart.\r\nHe expressed preference to follow-up with his outside hospital\r\nhematologist.\r\n- We will not recommend direct oral anticoagulants for this\r\ngentleman due to inability to monitor drug levels, history of\r\nrecurrent ___, and new LLE DVT while on eliquis 5 mg BID.\r\n. \r\nProphylaxis: as detailed above\r\n\r\n \r\nMedications on Admission:\r\nThe Preadmission Medication list may be inaccurate and requires \r\nfuther investigation.\r\n1.

In addition, you \r\nwere seen by the hematology team who recommended the appropriate \r\nmedications to help manage your blood clots. You have now \r\nrecovered from surgery and are ready to be discharged. Please \r\nfollow the instructions below to continue your recovery:\r\n\r\nACTIVITY: \r\n On the side of your amputation you are non weight bearing for \r\n___ weeks. \r\n You should keep this amputation site elevated when ever \r\npossible. \r\n You may use the opposite foot for transfers and pivots.\r\n No driving until cleared by your Surgeon.\r\n No heavy lifting greater than 20 pounds for the next 3 weeks. \r\n\r\nBATHING/SHOWERING: \r\n You may shower when you get home\r\n No tub baths or pools / do not soak your foot for 4 weeks from \r\nyour date of surgery \r\n\r\nWOUND CARE:\r\n Sutures / Staples may have been removed before discharge. If \r\nthey are not, an appointment will be made for you to return for \r\nstaple removal. \r\n When the sutures are removed the doctor may or may not place \r\npieces of tape called steri-strips over the incision.

Please follow the recommendations below to ensure a \r\nspeedy and uneventful recovery.\r\n\r\nLOWER  EXTREMITY AMPUTATION \r\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS\r\nACTIVITY \r\nYou should keep your amputation site elevated and straight \r\nwhenever possible.  This will prevent swelling of the stump and \r\nmaintain flexibility in your joint.  \r\nIt is very important that you put no weight or pressure on \r\nyour stump with activity or at rest to allow the wound to heal \r\nproperly. \r\nYou may use the opposite foot for transfers and pivots, if \r\napplicable.  It will take time to learn to use a walker and \r\nlearn to transfer into and out of a wheelchair.  \r\n\r\nMEDICATION\r\nBefore you leave the hospital, you will be given a list of all \r\nthe medicine you should take at home.  If a medication that you \r\nnormally take is not on the list or a medication that you do not \r\ntake is on the list please discuss it with the team!  \r\n\r\nYou will likely be prescribed narcotic pain medication on \r\ndischarge which  can be very constipating.  If you take \r\nnarcotics,  please also take a stool softener such as Colace.   \r\nIf constipation becomes a problem, your pharmacist can suggest \r\nan additional over the counter laxative. \r\n\r\nYou should take Tylenol ___ every 6 hours, as needed for \r\npain.

This will prevent swelling of the stump and \r\nmaintain flexibility in your joint.  \r\nIt is very important that you put no weight or pressure on \r\nyour stump with activity or at rest to allow the wound to heal \r\nproperly. \r\nYou may use the opposite foot for transfers and pivots, if \r\napplicable.  It will take time to learn to use a walker and \r\nlearn to transfer into and out of a wheelchair.  \r\n\r\nMEDICATION\r\nBefore you leave the hospital, you will be given a list of all \r\nthe medicine you should take at home.  If a medication that you \r\nnormally take is not on the list or a medication that you do not \r\ntake is on the list please discuss it with the team!  \r\n\r\nYou will likely be prescribed narcotic pain medication on \r\ndischarge which  can be very constipating.  If you take \r\nnarcotics,  please also take a stool softener such as Colace.   \r\nIf constipation becomes a problem, your pharmacist can suggest \r\nan additional over the counter laxative. \r\n\r\nYou should take Tylenol ___ every 6 hours, as needed for \r\npain.  If this is not enough, take your prescription narcotic \r\npain medication.  You should require less pain medication each \r\nday.  Do not take more than a daily total of 3000mg of Tylenol.  \r\nTylenol is used as an ingredient in some other over-the-counter \r\nand prescription medications.  Be aware of how much Tylenol you \r\nare taking in a day.\r\n\r\nBATHING/SHOWERING: \r\nYou may shower when you feel strong enough but no tub baths or \r\npools until you have permission from your surgeon and the \r\nincision is fully healed.\r\nAfter your shower, gently dry the incision well.   Do not rub \r\nthe area. \r\n\r\nWOUND CARE:\r\nPlease keep the wound clean and dry. It is very important that \r\nthere is no pressure on the stump.    If there is no drainage, \r\nyou may leave the incision open to air.  \r\nYour staples/sutures will remain in for at least 4 weeks.  At \r\nyour followup appointment, we will see if the incision has \r\nhealed enough to remove the staples. \r\nBefore you can be fitted for prosthesis (a man-made limb to \r\nreplace the limb that was removed) your incision needs to be \r\nfully healed. \r\n\r\nCALL THE OFFICE FOR: ___\r\nOpening, bleeding or drainage or odor from your stump incision \r\n\r\nRedness, swelling or warmth in your stump.\r\nFever greater than 101 degrees, chills, or worsening \r\nincisional/stump pain  \r\n\r\nIF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS, THE PROVIDER SHOULD CALL THE \r\nVASCULAR SURGERY OFFICE AT ___ TO DISCUSS.  \r\n \r\nFollowup Instructions:\r\n___\r\n"

During your hospitalization, you had surgery to \r\nremove unhealthy tissue on your lower extremity.  You tolerated \r\nthe procedure well and are now ready to be discharged from the \r\nhospital.   Please follow the recommendations below to ensure a \r\nspeedy and uneventful recovery.\r\n\r\nLOWER  EXTREMITY AMPUTATION \r\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS\r\nACTIVITY \r\nYou should keep your amputation site elevated and straight \r\nwhenever possible.  This will prevent swelling of the stump and \r\nmaintain flexibility in your joint.  \r\nIt is very important that you put no weight or pressure on \r\nyour stump with activity or at rest to allow the wound to heal \r\nproperly. \r\nYou may use the opposite foot for transfers and pivots, if \r\napplicable.  It will take time to learn to use a walker and \r\nlearn to transfer into and out of a wheelchair.  \r\n\r\nMEDICATION\r\nBefore you leave the hospital, you will be given a list of all \r\nthe medicine you should take at home.  If a medication that you \r\nnormally take is not on the list or a medication that you do not \r\ntake is on the list please discuss it with the team!  \r\n\r\nYou will likely be prescribed narcotic pain medication on \r\ndischarge which  can be very constipating.  If you take \r\nnarcotics,  please also take a stool softener such as Colace.   \r\nIf constipation becomes a problem, your pharmacist can suggest \r\nan additional over the counter laxative. \r\n\r\nYou should take Tylenol ___ every 6 hours, as needed for \r\npain.  If this is not enough, take your prescription narcotic \r\npain medication.  You should require less pain medication each \r\nday.  Do not take more than a daily total of 3000mg of Tylenol.  \r\nTylenol is used as an ingredient in some other over-the-counter \r\nand prescription medications.  Be aware of how much Tylenol you \r\nare taking in a day.\r\n\r\nBATHING/SHOWERING: \r\nYou may shower when you feel strong enough but no tub baths or \r\npools until you have permission from your surgeon and the \r\nincision is fully healed.\r\nAfter your shower, gently dry the incision well.   Do not rub \r\nthe area. \r\n\r\nWOUND CARE:\r\nPlease keep the wound clean and dry. It is very important that \r\nthere is no pressure on the stump.    If there is no drainage, \r\nyou may leave the incision open to air.  \r\nYour staples/sutures will remain in for at least 4 weeks.  At \r\nyour followup appointment, we will see if the incision has \r\nhealed enough to remove the staples. \r\nBefore you can be fitted for prosthesis (a man-made limb to \r\nreplace the limb that was removed) your incision needs to be \r\nfully healed. \r\n\r\nCALL THE OFFICE FOR: ___\r\nOpening, bleeding or drainage or odor from your stump incision \r\n\r\nRedness, swelling or warmth in your stump.\r\nFever greater than 101 degrees, chills, or worsening \r\nincisional/stump pain  \r\n\r\nIF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS, THE PROVIDER SHOULD CALL THE \r\nVASCULAR SURGERY OFFICE AT ___ TO DISCUSS.  \r\n \r\nFollowup Instructions:\r\n___\r\n"

His vascular surgical history is pertinent \r\nfor severe PAD and has priory undergone a attempt bypass (SFA to \r\n___ bypass with non-reversed GSV on ___ revascularization, \r\nwhich failed due to DVT and superimposed cellulitis requiring \r\nBKA in ___. He underwent a RLE fem-AT BP w/ spliced vein on \r\n___. He was discharged on ___. He states that when he left \r\n___, his foot was warm, and had intact sensation. He states \r\nthat for the past week, the R foot has been cold and painful. He \r\nreports that it is now numb to the level of the ankle. He became \r\nincreasingly\r\nconcerned when the foot became mottled, which is why he is \r\nseeking care today. \r\n\r\nOn admission the patient was started on a therapeutic heparin \r\ndrip as well as pain management.  He was consented for a right \r\nbelow the knee amputation.  Due to his foot with a prolonged \r\nperiod of being cold and mottled and pulseless, he was brought \r\nto the operating room on hospital day 2 for a right below the \r\nknee amputation.  Please see the surgeon's operative note for \r\ndetails.  After a brief uncomplicated stay in the PACU the \r\npatient was brought up to the vascular surgery floor where he \r\nremained throughout his admission.\r\n\r\nThe patient was resumed on a heparin drip postoperatively which \r\nremained therapeutic throughout his admission.  The hematology \r\nservice was consulted for management of his outpatient \r\nanticoagulation regimen.  After evaluation of the patient he \r\nrecommended Lovenox 80 mg twice daily as well as an aspirin \r\nregimen for prevention of DVTs and management of his peripheral \r\narterial disease.  The medicine service was consulted for \r\nmanagement of the patient's persistent sinus tachycardia \r\nthroughout his admission.  Due to the patient's blood loss \r\nintraoperatively and hemoglobin dropped from 12.2 on admission \r\nto 7.7 on postoperative day 2, the patient was given 1 unit of \r\nPRBCs.  After brief transfusion of this unit of red cells the \r\npatient developed a febrile transfusion reaction and the \r\ntransfusion was stopped.  A fever workup commenced which was \r\nnegative.  On postoperative day 3 the patient remained \r\ntachycardic, he spiked a fever and had rigors.  Another fever \r\nworkup was sent which was also negative. The patient received 1 \r\nunit of packed red blood cells.\r\n\r\nThroughout his admission the patient's pain was managed with the \r\nchronic pain service.  At home the patient takes gabapentin, \r\noxycodone for his pain management.  Postoperatively the patient \r\nwas on a Dilaudid PCA and was weaned to p.o. Dilaudid prior to \r\ndischarge.  After discharge at his acute rehab facility the \r\npatient will need to follow-up with his outpatient pain \r\nmanagement provider for titration of his narcotic pain \r\nmedications.\r\n\r\nThe patient has poorly controlled diabetes and the ___ \r\ndiabetic service was consulted for more strict control of his \r\nblood glucose.  The patient was restarted on his home metformin, \r\nand his insulin dose was adjusted until there was more \r\nappropriate control of his blood glucose between 100 200 on \r\nfingersticks.  The patient was encouraged to follow-up with his \r\nprimary care provider for outpatient management of his diabetes.\r\n\r\nThroughout his admission the patient worked with physical \r\ntherapy and actively participated in his care.  Physical therapy \r\nrecommended discharge to an acute rehab facility.\r\n\r\nPrior to discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet \r\nwithout any nausea or vomiting, he was working with physical \r\ntherapy and occupational therapy to complete his activities of \r\ndaily living.  His pain was well-controlled on oral pain \r\nmedications.  He was doing well postoperatively and was deemed \r\nappropriate for discharge to an acute rehab facility where he \r\ncan continue his recovery.  He will follow-up in 1 month's time \r\nin the vascular surgery clinic for his wound check and staple \r\nremoval. \r\n \r\nMedications on Admission:\r\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\r\n1.

The \r\ngreat vessels are normal in caliber. There is no pericardial \r\neffusion. \r\n  \r\nThe airways are patent to the subsegmental level. A 3 mm \r\nground-glass opacity in superior segment of the right lower lobe \r\nis noted (03:37). There is no focal consolidation, pleural \r\neffusion, or pneumothorax.

Morphology suggests chronic or subacute \r\nchronicity rather than acute pulmonary emboli.  \r\nThere is no CT evidence of right heart strain such as \r\nstraightening of the \r\nintraventricular septum or reflux of contrast into the hepatic \r\nveins. The \r\ngreat vessels are normal in caliber. There is no pericardial \r\neffusion. \r\n  \r\nThe airways are patent to the subsegmental level. A 3 mm \r\nground-glass opacity in superior segment of the right lower lobe \r\nis noted (03:37). There is no focal consolidation, pleural \r\neffusion, or pneumothorax. There is no axillary, \r\nsupraclavicular, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy. Residual \r\nthymic tissue is noted in the anterior mediastinum. \r\n  \r\nThis study is not optimized for evaluation of infra \r\ndiaphragmatic structures.  \r\nWithin these limitations, other than a hypodensity at the liver \r\ndome likely representing a simple hepatic cyst, the visualized \r\nupper abdomen is \r\nunremarkable. \r\n  \r\nThere is no focal lytic or sclerotic osseous lesion suggestive \r\nof neoplasm or infection. \r\n  \r\nIMPRESSION:  \r\nSubsegmental pulmonary emboli in the right lower lobe \r\ndemonstrate morphology but is more consistent with subacute or \r\nchronic emboli rather than acute pulmonary emboli.
